I'm alone above the atmosphere
And no one looking up can find me here
'Cause I can close my eyes and disappear

When I climb the stairs to watch the sun
Above the station walls the colors run
To fill the swimming pool when I am done

I am the captain of an oil tanker that travels through your veins

When the satellites hang all around
And I can finally hear a lovely sound
When all the engines in the back room die down

All the airships move across the sky
And my equipment just keeps standing by
The planets glow and intensify

I am the pilot of a cargo airplane that travels through your veins

When you are lying half-asleep in your room
Unaware if it is midnight or afternoon

Because the water doesn't flood the stairwell
It could be raining but then you can never tell

If you're alone in this awful downpour
Then struggle free and paddle out the cellar door

In the evening light the boulevard
Conceals the night with disregard
For all the workers in a west coast ship yard

When I rearrange the silverware
And re-install the lights in captain's chair
I'll lift the ceiling off to breathe the ocean air

I am the engineer of forty freight trains that travel through your veins

When you are lying half asleep in your room
Unaware if it is midnight or afternoon

Because the water doesn't flood the stairwell
It could be raining but then you can never tell

If you're awake in this awful downpour
Then struggle free and paddle out the cellar door

When you are swimming in Miami at night
I'm all around you in the traffic and city lights

===================


I am stuck in L.A. through the week and cant get away
And you're alone on the pier in West Palm Beach on your holiday
Stormy nights, re-awake the stomach ache 
That I've acquired, from feeling down
Things look grim and I'm so sick of being tired

Apartment lights go dark and its depressing
But what can I do?
The midnight streets feel dead
When I am so used to driving with you

Brighter lights fill the night
And bluer skys reflect in your eyes
As I inspect and analyze
All of these dreams I don't recognize

If you're still up when the ships in the port prepare to set sail
Comb the beach and put those blue flowers up in your ponytail
Inside my head your voice is still resounding but what can I do?
The empty rooms feel cold when I am so used to being with you

Count the stars, watch the waves absorb the summer sun
And think of me when you explore hidden coves 
And tiny island chains throughout the sea
Can you still, hear my voice
When I'm outside, from over the phone?

For what it's worth, darling dear
I wish you were here, 'cause I feel alone
When you were home we'd sing 
But since you've left I dont hear anything
Though I feel so sad
I can't believe things are really that bad

Old captains and brand new cruise ships
Sailing over the briny sea
When I crashed my beloved desk job
And swim through the debris

I'll cut loose leave this mad house
Bound for the Atlantic blue
I'll stroll down your treelined driveway
And sail the ocean with you

===================


Affection, the gifted architect,
Is making a draft and beautiful design
The options and possibilities
Are endless when we connect and re-align

Collections of books and documents
Arise and parade around my cluttered desk
Reworking the math and measurements
Until I'm convinced these plans are picturesque
Like mountains in the Midwest

Reaction creates the columns dark
And wide like the roads around Fort Lauderdale
The structures begin to take their shape 
Before I've designed the public monorail

The turnpike and high-speed motorway
Connect and enclose the quaint suburban streets
The airport, the broad suspension bridge
The lake and the beach where several rivers meet
Compounded from the spreadsheet

A city sparkles in the night
How can it glow so bright?
The neighborhoods surround the soft florescent light
Designer skyline in my head
Abstract and still well-read
You went from numbered lines to buildings overhead

===================


I'm moving to Tokyo
Cuz I'm tired of San Francisco
My contracts are finally void
And I am getting out
On houses and building tops
I swallow the beams and sun drops
If my echos can reach your ears
Then I could save my calls
What happens when I'm above
The east river when you are in love
We're staring at all these lights
And I am going blind

Fill all of the navy yards
With hard working security guards
Cuz the numbers are wearing off
My plastic access cards
How can I begin to say
I feel better off when we stay
In Paris on winter nights
Beneath the snowy veil
Content like a panda bear
Still breathing the fresh mountain air
I'll put on a diving tank
And sing when I inhale

===================


When I am fast asleep
I dream and see you floating high above me
And I awake at dawn
Before the rays of morning paint the front lawn
From on the bedroom floor
I watch you sailing far above the seashore

In deep Atlantic skies
You float as I look aft to watch the moon rise
Above the avenue
I search among the clouds, trying to see you
But you are just a blur
In the sky when you parachute over the harbor

I can see
You above with the ocean around me
If I could only stay
Overhead in the airway
You sail through
Endless sky with the evening around you
When I'm out on the bay
You're aloft in the airway

When I'm alone at night
I dream you paint the stars against the twilight
Suspended in the air
I wish your silhouette would always stay there
When I am on the beach
I watch you held aloft way out of my reach

But I can not take flight
Or float upon the air the way that you might
When I am in the sea
You gazed down from the sky, trying to see me
But I am just a blur
Through the waves, as I scuba dive below the harbor

The airway
You and I in the airway
Aloft in the airway
In love on the airway

I can see
You above with the ocean around me
If I could only stay
Overhead in the airway
You sail through
Endless sky with the evening around you
When I'm out on the bay
You're aloft in the airway

===================


If I could look across the country
From California to New Jersey
Then I would count the parks and lake resorts
And number all the jets and airports
All those rather dreary rain clouds still bother me
Cause I look through the camera eyepiece and cannot see

If I could open up my window
And see from Tampa Bay to Juneau
Then I would survey all those open miles
And line them up in single file
Everywhere I look I see green scenic sublime
And all those oceanic vistas are so divine

If I was standing on the balcony
And you were walking down below
I'd feel rather depressed and out of place
And lonely just to watch you go
If you were swinging from the highway overpass
Within the western hemisphere
I'd feel rather afraid and insincere
If you began to disappear

If I was walking through a sad art gallery
And you were driving through the night
I'd feel rather alone and ill at ease
Beneath the brilliant showroom light
If I was flying on a plane above your town
And you were gazing at the sky
Somehow I'd feel intact and reassured
If you began to wave goodbye

===================


Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer
In the hills and highlands
I fall asleep in hospital parking lots
And awake in your mouth

Hello Seattle, I am a manta ray
Deep beneath the blue waves
I'll crawl the sandy bottom of Puget Sound
And construct a summer home

Hello Seattle, I am the crescent moon
Shining down on your face
I will disguise myself as a sleeping pill
And descend inside of you

Hello Seattle, I am a cold seahorse
Feeling warm in your sand
I sing about the tide and the ocean surf
Rolling in the evening breeze

Hello Seattle, I am an albatross
On the docks and moored boats
I sail above your inlets and interstates
Through the rain and open wind

Hello Seattle, I am an old lighthouse
Throwing beams of bright lights
Red in the morning, blue in the evening sun
Taking heed for everyone

Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer
In the hills and highlands
I fall asleep in hospital parking lots

Take me above your light
Carry me through the night
Hold me secure in flight
Sing me to sleep tonight

Take me above your light (Hello Seattle)
Carry me through the night (I am a mountaineer, in the hills and highlands)
Hold me secure in flight (I fall asleep in hospital)
Sing me to sleep tonight (parking lots, and awake in your house)

===================


Breathe and I'll carry you away into the velvet sky
And we'll stir the stars around
And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
And plummet out of sight and sound
The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
Where I live in the alpine heights
Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
Alone, awake and thinking of...the weekend we were in love

Home among these mountain tops can be so awfully dull
A thousand miles from the tide
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
Distract me so I stay inside
I wish the rockets stayed over the promenade
Cuz I would make a hook and eye
And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I
We're hanging on so take us high
To sing the world goodbye...

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view
Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling, we're both on the wing, look down and keep on singing!
And we can go anywhere

Are you there?
Are you there, or are you just a decoy dream in my head?
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone? 

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view
Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling, we're both on the wing, look down and keep on singing!
And we can go anywhere

Are you there?

===================


High rise, veins of the avenue
Bright eyes and subtle variations of blue
Everywhere is balanced there like a rainbow above you
Street lights glisten on the boulevard
And cold nights make staying alert so hard
For heaven's sake, keep me awake so I won't be caught off guard
Clearly I am a passerby but I'll find a place to stay
Dear pacific day, won't you take me away?
Small town hearts of the New Year
Brought down by gravity, crystal clear
City fog and brave dialogue converge on the frontier
Make haste, I feel your heartbeat
With new taste for speed, out on the street
Find a road to a humble abode where both of our routes meet
The silver sound is all around and the colors fall like snow
The feeling of letting go, I guess we'll never know

Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains
And I'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins
'Cause your heart has a lack of colour and we should've known
That we'd grow up sooner or later 'Cause we wasted all our free time alone

Your nerves gather with the altitude
Exhale the stress so you don't come unglued
Somewhere there is a happy affair, a ghost of a good mood
Wide eyed, panic on the getaway
The high tide could take me so far away
VCR's and motorcars unite on the Seventh Day
A popular gauge will measure the rage of the new Post-Modern Age
'Cause somewhere along the line all the decades align.

We were the crashing whitecaps
On the ocean
And what lovely sea-side holiday, away
A palm tree in Christmas lights
My emotion
Struck a sparkling tone like a xylophone
As we spent the day alone

Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains
And I'll blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins
'Cause your heart has a lack of color and we should've known
That we'd grow up sooner or later 'cause we wasted all our free time alone

===================


Glamour and fashion
Models and magazines... a striking runway entrance
Beauty and passion
Stardust and high class scenes of popular teens
When I lived in Denver, I met a millionaire
With ribbons in her blonde hair
I still remember
She was like a princess straight from a dreamy castle in the air

So lovely...
She was everything to me

Both alone in the dark
We long to see the sun
Rise over the Bering Strait
I was sick of the west
When I turned 21
So I moved to the Sunshine State
We played golf on the moon
And tennis on the sun
Like athletes of the afternoon
The solar flares burned my arms
And made her makeup run
On our super lunar honeymoon

I was the youngest son of a congressman
And everything was my fault...
She was a gymnast, happily swinging
On the uneven bars, tucked in a somersault

So lovely...
She was everything to me...

So lovely...
She was everything to me...

Both alone in the dark
We long to see the sun
Rise over the Bering Strait
I was sick of the west
When I turned 21
So I moved to the Sunshine State
We played golf on the moon
And tennis on the sun
Like athletes of the afternoon
The solar flares burned my arms
And made her makeup run
On our super lunar honeymoon

===================


I opened my eyes last night
And saw you in the low light
Walking down by the bay, on the shore,
Staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore

I was feeling the night grow old
And you were looking so cold
Like an introvert,
I drew my over shirt
Around my arms and began to shiver violently before...

... you happened to look and see
The tunnels all around me
Running into the dark underground
All the subways around create a great sound

To my motion fatigue farewell,
With your ear to a seashell
You can hear the waves
In underwater caves
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room

Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone,
I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
We need time, only time

When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home,
Why does it feel so alone?
So tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

Can you believe that the crew has gone
And wouldn't let me sign on?
All my islands have sunk in the deep,
So I can hardly relax or even oversleep

I feel as if I were home some nights,
When we count all the ship lights.
I guess I'll never know
Why sparrows love the snow
We'll turn off all of the lights
And set this ballroom aglow

(So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time)

Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone,
I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
We need time, only time

When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home,
Why does it feel so alone?
So tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?

So tell me, darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time

===================


Good evening, shuttle bus! Tell me where you're going to take us
Someplace that I have never been
It's chic transportation to new destination where I leave my reflection on the glass
I'd ask but we don't know how far these interstates go
Or how deep the city roots go down
In chilly sub-depth railways, the weathered concrete stairways provide me with a means of getting home... if I ever leave

On crystal sand, we sleep hand-in-hand
While soothing words hover like hummingbirds

So many sights to see so wake up like an early birdie
And we'll get a head start on the day
Stained-glass skyways and crowded 6 lane highways
If I look back when I begin to leave, will they remember me?

Circuit flights bend the lights when I am spent
And tour guides make happy brides feel heaven-sent

===================


The bird is here and we are off to wherever those wings take us
The atmosphere is crawling with airlines
That wind through the clouds and look down on the crowds

Relax your back and let the noise sing you to sleep in my arms
If you awake before we arrive I will carry you down and I won't make a sound

The scent is strong as we move on and breathe in the pristine crime scene
The false veneer is old like a substitute volunteer from, oh, some other year

I'm just a shell as far as I can tell, so I paint my eyes a light green
The silver beams are twirling and swirling throughout your dreams like air traffic streams

===================


I am the red in the rose, the flowers
on the blankets on your bedroom floor.
And I am the gray in the ghost that hides
with your clothes behind your closet door.

I am the green in the grass that bends back
from underneath your feet.
And I am the blue in your back alley view
where the horizon and the rooftops meet.

If you cut me I suppose I would bleed the colors
of the evening stars.
You can go anywhere you wish 'cause I'll be there, wherever you are.
(wherever you are) [2x]

(I will always meet your gaze)
when we are lost in the technicolor phase)

I am the black in the book
the letters on the pages that you memorize.
And I am the orange in the overcast
a color that you visualize.

I am the white in the walls that soak up
all the sound when you cannot sleep.
And I am the peach in the starfish on the beach
that wish the harbor wasn't quite so deep.

If you cut me I suppose I would bleed the colors
of the evening stars. (my darling)
You can go anywhere you wish 'cause I'll be there, wherever you are. (my darling)

(wherever you are) [3x]

===================


I stood up and took a breath and threw open the bay doors
Below the clouds I saw the coast and beautiful Hawaii
Leaning back, the pilot smiled and shouted,
"Have a good trip!"
I signed off and closed my eyes.
Then I was falling through the sky

===================


I regarded the world as such a sad sight
Until I viewed it in black and white
Then I reviewed every frame and basic shape
And sealed the exits with caution tape
Don't refocus your eyes in the darkness
And don't remember this place unless
I describe all the things that you cannot see
And we'll unravel the mystery

Farewell, all my friends in textbooks, I'm going home
Cuz my blood cells cannot depend on the weather in photographs 
There's a light show out my window somewhere way up there
Dear Vienna, are you singing?
Dear Vienna, are you swinging?
Dear Vienna, we were happy like the shades of May when we got carried away

I was so far out of place
Watching those stars in outer space
Cuz I am so far from where you are

===================


If we could sit together a moment
And talk forever just to pass the time
I would smile as the shivers and chills run down my spine
When your eyes are locked on mine

Oh we'll fill the metro skies with country air
And when you close your tired eyes I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there

I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there

Deep inside of you there's a ruby glow
And it gets brighter than you and I will ever know
There's a rushing sound that surrounds us when we walk alone
And it's everything we've never known

Wander down the street
And I would be the pavement beneath your feet
If we could just be immobile for some time
And finally figure out the way we feel
About the missing puzzle pieces and cloudy question marks
That still look a bit surreal

Oh I tend to disappear here and there
So concentrate and you'll feel me everywhere
And we'll fill the metro skies with country air
If you're lost when you close your eyes I'll meet you there

I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there

You could be anywhere
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
You could be anywhere
I'll meet you there
I'll meet you there
Open your eyes and see
You could be anywhere
Everything you can be
I'll meet you there
Open your eyes and see
You could be anywhere
Everything you can be
I'll meet you there

===================


Wake up on your own
And look around you 'cause you're not alone
Release your high hopes and they'll survive
'Cause this is the future and you are alive

Dive in and swim away
From your lonely nights and miserable days

And when you wake up on your own
Look around you 'cause you're not alone
Let your hopes go and they'll survive
'Cause this is the future and you are alive
You're headed home,
You're headed home

===================


Are you out there
Where the rainy days begin
To feel rather sad
And the walls are closing in
Like the darkness around me
It's so hard to look away
When the daylight doesn't ever stay
Above this dull apartment view
Oh, I will surround you

It's quite clear that I'm stuck here
So I'll devise a plan
And cut out a door in my new living room floor
The porch light is so bright
That I will quickly sneak down the dark metal shape
Of the rusty fire escape

I bought a one way ticket
Cause I knew I'd never see the ground
Unless I was aboard a jet plane
And we were going down
When I wiped the tears from my eyes
The warm water took me by surprise
And I woke up beside the ocean
I realized I must be in California

Aloha, my happy west coast friends
Do you feel alive
When the breaking waves arrive
And wash all around you
The beach homes and ocean side
Are quite well known by the evening tide
And we can sleep where we reside
With redwoods around us
The blue air is up there
And could I bring it down
I bottle it up and save it for a sweet summer night

I bought a one way ticket
Cause I knew I'd never see the ground
Unless I was aboard a jet plane
And we were going down
When I wiped the tears from my eyes
The warm water took me by surprise
And I woke up beside the ocean
I realized I must be in California
I must be in California

Am I awake or is this just a dream?

The new year is out here
And I will make a lovely list
Of your charms
So I'll never feel alone in your arms

I must be in California
I must be in California
I must be in California

===================


Please take a long hard look
Through your text book 'cause I'm history
When I strap my helmet on I'll be long gone
'Cause I've been dying to leave
Yeah, I'll ride the range
And hide all my loose change in my bedroll
'Cause riding a dirt bike down a turn pike
Always takes its toll on me

I've had just about enough
Of quote "diamonds in the rough"
Because my backbone is paper thin
Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in
(I'll cave in, I'll cave in...)

If the bombs go off the sun will still be shining
(The sun will still be shining)
Because I've heard it said that
Every mushroom cloud has a silver lining
(Though I'm always undermining too deep to know)
Swallow a drop of gravel and blacktop
'Cause the road tastes like Wintergreen
The wind and the rain smell of oil and octane
Mixed with stale gasoline

I'll soak up the sound
Try to sleep on the wet ground
I'll get ten minutes give or take
'Cause I just don't foresee myself getting drowsy
When cold integrity keeps me wide awake
(Awake, awake, awake, awake...)

Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in
(Cave in, cave in, cave in, cave in...)

Get me out of this cavern or I'll cave in

I'll keep my helmet on
Just in case my head caves in
(In case my head caves in)
'Cause if my thoughts collapse
Or my framework snaps
It'll make a mess like you wouldn't believe
Tie my handle bars to the stars
So I stay on track (so I stay on track)
And if my intentions stray I'll wrench them away
Then I'll take my leave and I won't even look back

I won't even look back

(Da da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da daaa...)

===================


If you're the bird
Whenever we pretend it's summer
Then I'm the worm
I know the part, it's such a bummer

But fair is fair
If my segments get separated
I'll scream
And you'll be there

Close your eyes
(Close my eyes)
Slide the cotton off of your shoulder
And feel the shine
(Feel the shine)
I'm hooked so toss me over
And cast a line
(Well, I'll try)
I'll throw a party and greet my undersea friends
(It depends)
As they arrive
(If they arrive)

You and I left our troubles far behind
(Troubles far behind)
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With friends like these, well,
Who needs enemies?

If I'm your boy
Let's take a shortcut we remember
And we'll enjoy
Picking apples in late September like
We've done for years
Then we'll take a long walk
Through the cornfield
And I'll kiss you
Between the ears

If you're my girl
Swirl me around your room with feeling
And as we twirl
The glow in the dark stars on your ceiling
Will shine for us
As love sweeps over the room
'Cause we tend to make
Each other blush
(you make me blush)

You and I left our troubles far behind
(Troubles far behind)
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With fronds like these, well,
Who needs anemones?

You're the bird, I'm the worm
And it's plain to see
That we were meant to be

We were meant to be
We were meant to be
(If you're the bird,
If you're the bird,
Then I'm the worm)
We were meant to be

Hello Seattle, I am a mountaineer

And awake in your mouth

Carry me through the night
Hold me secure in flight
Sing me to sleep tonight

Take me above your light (Hello Seattle)
Carry me through the night (I am a mountaineer, in the hills and highlands)
Hold me secure in flight (I fall asleep in hospital)
Sing me to sleep tonight (parking lots, and awake in your house)

Stems and gears, oh how the daisies bloom
When chandeliers light up the engine room
Can you feel the drops as it starts to rain
There's an underwater Ferris wheel
Where I found the missing link to this island chain

Home will always be here, unseen, outta sight
Where I disappear and hide
I think dreamy things as I'm waving goodbye
So I'll spread out my wings and fly

Home is a boxcar and it's so far out of reach
Hidden under umbrella beach

Home will always be here, unseen, outta sight
Where I disappear and hide
I think dreamy things as I'm waving goodbye
So I'll spread out my wings and fly

I'll spread my wings and fly

Home is a boxcar and it's so far out of reach
Hidden under umbrella beach

I brush my teeth, and look in the mirror
And laugh out loud as I'm beaming from ear to ear
I'd rather pick flowers, instead of fights
And rather than flaunt my style
I'd flash you a smile, of clean pearly whites

I've been to the dentist a thousand times so I know the drill
I smooth my hair, sit back in the chair
But somehow I still get the chills

"Have a seat" he says pleasantly
As he shakes my hand, and practically laughs at me
"Open up nice and wide" he says peering in
And with a smirk he says "Don't have a fit, this'll just pinch a bit"
As he tries not to grin

When hygienists leave on long vacations
That's when dentists scream and lose their patience

Talking only brings the toothaches on,
Because I say the stupidest things
So if my resolve goes South
I'll swallow my pride with an aspirin, and shut my mouth

Golf and alcohol don't mix
And that's why I don't drink and drive
Because, good grief I'd knock out my teeth,
And have to kiss my smile goodbye

I've been to the dentist a thousand times so I know the drill
I smooth my hair, sit back in the chair
But somehow I still get the chills

===================


I can finally see that You're right there beside me
I am not my own, for I have been made new
Please don't let me go I desperately need You

I am not my own, for I have been made new
Please don't let me go I desperately need You

===================


Breathe and I'll carry you away into the velvet sky
And we'll stir the stars around
And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
And plummet out of sight and sound
The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
Where I live in the alpine heights
Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
Alone, awake and thinking of...the weekend we were in love

Home among these mountain tops can be so awfully dull
A thousand miles from the tide
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
Distract me so I stay inside
I wish the rockets stayed over the promenade
Cuz I would make a hook and eye
And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I
We're hanging on so take us high
To sing the world goodbye...

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view
Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling, we're both on the wing, look down and keep on singing!
And we can go anywhere

Are you there?
Are you there, or are you just a decoy dream in my head?
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone? 

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue and I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view
Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling, we're both on the wing, look down and keep on singing!
And we can go anywhere

Are you there?

===================


You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude
But I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread
(Thread, thread...)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
(Ha-ha)

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(Said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
(Jar, jar, jar...)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams

===================


Welcome back
Winter once again
And put on your warm fuzzy sweater
'Cause you'll feel much better when

The snowflakes fall
Gently to the ground
The temperature drops
And your shivers freeze all the rivers around
But I keep you warm

If speed's a pro
Inertia must be a con
'Cause the cold wind blows at precise rates
When I've got my ice skates on

If all the roads
Were paved with ice that wouldn't thaw or crack
I could skate from Maine to Nebraska
Then on to Alaska and back
'Cause you keep me warm

Peer over the edge
Can you see me?
Rivulets flow from your eyes
Paint runs from your mouth
Like a waterfall
And your lungs crystallize

I'll travel the sub-zero tundra
I'll brave glaciers and frozen lakes
And that's just the tip of the iceberg
I'll do whatever it takes
To change

Farewell powdery paradise
We'd rather skate on the thinnest ice
Fingers failed us before they froze
And frostbite bit down on all our toes

Snow drifts build up and enfold us
As we wait out this winter storm
So we snuggle close in the darkness
And keep each other so warm

===================


The stars lean down to kiss you
And I lie awake and miss you
Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere

'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly
But I'll miss your arms around me
I'd send a postcard to you, dear
'Cause I wish you were here

I'll watch the night turn light blue
But it's not the same without you
Because it takes two to whisper quietly

The silence isn't so bad
'Til I look at my hands and feel sad
'Cause the spaces between my fingers
Are right where yours fit perfectly

I'll find repose in new ways
Though I haven't slept in two days
'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone

But drenched in vanilla twilight
I'll sit on the front porch all night
Waist deep in thought because when
I think of you I don't feel so alone

I don't feel so alone
I don't feel so alone

As many times as I blink
I'll think of you tonight

I'll think of you tonight

When violet eyes get brighter
And heavy wings grow lighter
I'll taste the sky and feel alive again

And I'll forget the world that I knew
But I swear I won't forget you
Oh, if my voice could reach back through the past
I'd whisper in your ear,
"Oh, darling, I wish you were here."

===================


I wish I could cross my arms, and cross your mind
Cause I believe you'd unfold your paper heart and wear it on your sleeve
All my life I wish I broke mirrors, instead of promises
Cause all I see, is a shattered conscience staring right back at me
I wish I had covered all my tracks completely cause I'm so afraid
Is that the light at the far end of the tunnel or just the train?
Lift your arms only heaven knows, where the danger grows
And it's safe to say there's a bright light up ahead and help is on the way
(Help is on the way, Help is on the way, Help is on the way...)

Help is on the way
I forget the last time I felt brave, I just recall insecurity
Cause it came down like a tidal wave, and sorrow swept over me

Depression, please cut to the chase and cut a long story short
Oh please be done. How much longer can this drama afford to run?
Fate looks sharp, severs all my ties and breaks whatever doesn't bend
But sadly then, all my heavy hopes just pull me back down again
(Back down again, back down again, back down again...)

I forget the last time I felt brave, I just recall insecurity
Cause it came down like a tidal wave, and sorrow swept over me
Then I was given grace and love, I was blind but now I can see
Cause I found a new hope from above, and courage swept over me

It hurts just to wake up, whenever you're wearing thin
Alone on the outside, so tired of looking in
The end is uncertain and I've never been so afraid
But I don't need a telescope to see that there's hope
And that makes me feel brave

===================


We wrote a prelude to our own fairytale
And bought a parachute at a church rummage sale.
And with a mean sewing machine and miles of thread
We sewed the day above L.A. in navy and red.

We round a racetrack through your mom's kitchen chairs
And fought the shadows back down your dark basement stairs.
I lit a match and let it catch to light up the room.
And then you yelled as we beheld an old maroon.

Hot air balloon.

I'll be out of my mind,
And you'll be out of ideas pretty soon.
So let's spend the afternoon
In a cold hot air balloon.
Leave your jacket behind,
Lean out and touch the tree tops over town.
I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back down.

We drank the Great Lakes like cold lemonade.
And both got stomach aches sprawled out in the shade.
So bored to death you held your breath and I tried not to yawn.
You make my frown turn upside down and now my worries are gone.

I'll be out of my mind,
And you'll be out of ideas pretty soon.
So let's spend the afternoon
In a cold hot air balloon.
Leave your jacket behind,
Lean out and touch the tree tops over town.
I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back down.

I'll be out of my mind,
And you'll be out of ideas pretty soon.
So let's spend the afternoon
In a cold hot air balloon.
Leave your jacket behind,
Lean out and touch the tree tops over town.
I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back down.

===================


If i was a raindrop
would you be my thunderstorm?
It's cold so surround me
With rain clouds to keep me warm
I feel like I'm falling
So darling don't let me go
The thought is appalling but should I slip away
Into the stormy sea will you remember me?

Asleep in a warm cocoon
We dream of lovely things
We're both gonna wake up soon
So we hope that tomorrow brings
Us our butterfly wings

If i was a grain of sand
Would you be Miami Beach
So dusty with starlight
Close your eyes and cuddle close to me
I'll try not to wake you
Or make a sound while you're dozing off
But in the night should the high tides sweep me away from you
Tell me again my dear will you be waiting here?

Whenever we leave the ground
And take to the sky
I'll smile as I'm gazing down
Cause I've always wonder why we won't need feathers to fly

===================


Toupee or not toupee 
That is the question 
It refused to stay as it all turned grey; 
William Shakespeare's receding hair 
Please excuse the pun, 
'It's hair today, gone tomorrow' 
So be thankful 
For what precious locks you have 

Toupee or not toupee 
That is the question 
And by the way 
I just gotta say 
Thank the Lord I'm not going bald 
And if I may quip 
My curls and I 
Are just like heaven 
'Cause rest assured 
There'll be no parting there 

But should my head get bare like Friar Tuck 
(Our chase to swallow)
It makes me smile 
'Cause I know just what I'd do 

Yeah if I had more wigs than I knew what to do with 
I'd open a secondhand store 
And if you ever went bald 
You'd recall it 
'Cause I'd cleverly call it 
'Rugs From Me To You'

===================


So there we were, back home from somewhere inside my head
Oh, bravely I fought off the monsters beneath her bed
Pillars of postwar books supported by frame of mind
While she memorized the pages that I tried to not hide behind
She took my hand in hers and whispered her love for me
The lantern died that night but we didn't need to see
Implying that she's the bee's knees and I am the cat's meow
It's funny how she recalls what I can't remember now 

But when her smile came back and I didn't feel half as horrible
She gave me a heart attack just because she looked so adorable
We both put our sunblock on, played on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn
Yeah, but she got a tan, and I got a sunburn
I got a sunburn

So there we were out there, unaware of where we'd been
We kicked off our flipflops and swung from the rooftops again
It's awkward but I'll confess she's all I can think about
And it's funny how I recall what she can't remember now

But when her smile came back and I didn't feel half as horrible
She gave me a heart attack just because she looked so adorable
We both put our sunblock on, played on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn
Yeah, but she got a tan, and I got a sunburn

Oh, afterglow, look out below
We left a trail of dust behind
As we parted ways, she held my gaze
And left an imprint on my mind
I tried not to cry as we said goodbye
And hung the clouds above my town
But I shed a tear when she disappeared
Cause now I'm a stranger on the ground

When her smile came back and I didn't feel half as horrible
She gave me a heart attack
We both put our sunblock on, played on the beach and vowed that we'd live and we'd learn
But she got a tan, and I got a sunburn
She got a tan, and I got a sunburn
Yeah, but she got a tan, and I got a sunburn

===================


You're the sky that I fell through
And I remember the view whenever I'm holding you
The sun hung from a string
Looking down on the world as it warms over everything
Chills run down my spine as our fingers entwine
And your sighs harmonize with mine
Unmistakably
I can still feel your heart
Beat fast when you dance with me

We got older and I should have known
(Do you feel alive?)
That I'd feel colder when I walk alone
(Oh, but you'll survive)
So I may as well ditch my dismay
(Bombs away... Bombs away...)

Circle me and the needle moves gracefully
Back and forth, if my heart was a compass you'd be North
Risk it all cause I'll catch you if you fall
Wherever you go, if my heart was a house you'd be home

It makes me smile because you said it best
I would clearly feel blessed if the sun rose up from the west
Flower balm perfume, all my clothes smell like you
Cause your favorite shade is navy blue

I walk slowly when I'm on my own
(Do you feel alive?)
Yeah, but frankly I still feel alone
(Oh, but you'll survive)
So I may as well ditch my dismay
(Bombs away... Bombs away...)

Circle me and the needle moves gracefully
Back and forth, if my heart was a compass you'd be North
Risk it all cause I'll catch you if you fall
Wherever you go, if my heart was a house you'd be home

If my heart was a house, you'd be home

===================


This is a world of dreams and reverie
Where I felt the stars explode around me
A grass blade flashed with a gleam as it slashed open a moonbeam
And I stared back breathlessly
As mountains of fruit tumbled out I barely had the chance to shout
Oh strawberry avalanche, crash over me

Staying awake that night was rather hard
Deep in a sleeping bag in your back yard
When we woke up buried alive
Beneath the fruity landslide
We both laughed hysterically
It could've been just another dream
But, I swear I heard you scream
Oh strawberry avalanche, crash over me

Oh, there's a citrus constellation in the galaxy
Scratched on the back of both my eyelids
That I've been dying to see

If you were a beautiful sound in the echoes all around
Then I'd be your harmony
And we'd sing along with the crowds
Beneath the candy coated clouds
Oh strawberry avalanche please crash over me

This is a world of dreams and reverie
Where I felt the stars explode around me

===================


I saw the autumn leaves peel up off the street,
take wing on the balmy breeze and sweep you off your feet. 

You blushed as they scooped you up on sugar maple wings,
to gaze down on the city below, ablaze with wondrous things.

Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere.
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldn’t want to live there.

I wouldn’t wanna live there!

Weighed down by heavy lids and lunar lullabies,
I knew you were wide awake because you smile with your eyes.

Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere.
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldn’t want to live there.

From the green belt balcony, the wildfires look so pretty.
Ponderosa canopy, I’d never leave if it were up to me.
To the ruby redwood tree, and to the velvet climbing ivy:
painted all mahogany, I’d never leave if it were up to me.

..If it were up to me..

With a starry brush, paint the dusk venetian blue,
because in the evening hush, you’ll never believe the view.
And when the leaves return and their whisperings fill the night,
they’ll freeze and burn where fire and ice collide.

Can you feel a silk embrace in the satin air?
If we dissolve without a trace, will the real world even care?
Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere.
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldn’t want to live there.

I wouldn’t want to live there!

I saw the autumn leaves peel up off the street,
take wing on the balmy breeze and sweep you off your feet.

===================


Met a girl in the parking lot,
And all I did was say hello.
Her pepper spray made it rather hard
For me to walk her home,
But I guess that's the way it goes.

Tell me again was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye.
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
Well smile because you're the deer in the headlights.

Met a girl with a graceful charm,
But when beauty met the beast he froze.
Got the sense I was not her type
By black eye and bloody nose,
But I guess that's the way it goes.

Tell me again was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye.
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
Well smile because you're the deer in the headlights.

It's suffocating to say,
But the female mystique takes my breath away.
So give me a smile or give me a sneer,
'Cause I'm trying to guess here.

Tell me again was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye.
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
I'm sorry I ever tried, deer in the headlights.

Tell me again was it love at first sight
When I walked by and you caught my eye.
Didn't you know love could shine this bright?
If life was a game, you would never play nice.
If love was a beam, you'd be blind in both eyes.
Put your sunglasses on 'cause you're a deer in the headlights.

You're the deer in the headlights.
You're the deer in the headlights.

===================


Wake me if you're out there

Through the glass in my bedroom window
In the bushes far below
I thought I saw an unfamiliar shadow
Among the ones I so clearly know

I've been sleeping with the night light unplugged
With a note on the rocking chair
That says, "I'm dreaming of the life I once loved,
So wake me if you're out there."

Living close to the ground
Is seventh Heaven 'cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts
So wake me if you're out there!

Wake me if you're out there

In the dust on my cellar staircase
A pair of footprints followed me
I saw a flicker in the fake fireplace
Blinked again but there was nothing to see

I've been leaving all the windows unlocked
With a basket by the oak tree
'Cause I'll be pickin' up the acorns that fall off
If you'll be climbing up to meet me

Living close to the ground
Is seventh Heaven 'cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts
Wake me if you're out there

I keep my knees black and blue
'Cause they often hit the hard wood floor
(Wake me if you're out there)
And I believe so
I'm not praying to the ceiling anymore

I've been sleeping with the night light unplugged
With a note on the rocking chair
That says, "I'm dreaming of the life I once loved,
So wake me if you're out there."

Living close to the ground
Is seventh Heaven 'cause there are angels all around
Among my frivolous thoughts
I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts

The indications reveal
(Wake me if you're out there)
That few of us realize life is quite surreal
So if you're dying to see
I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity
So if you're dying to see
I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity

===================


[Verse 1]
Splash down in the silver screen
Into a deep dramatic scene
I swim through the theater
Or maybe I'm just a dreamer
Like a kite in the bright midday
Wonder stole my breath away
Shy sonata for Mercury
The stars always sing so pretty

[Chorus:]
This picnic will soon depart
Real life, I'm sad to see you go
I'll miss you with all my heart
But I'd rather be alone
'Cause I couldn't live without
Sunsets that dazzle in the dusk
So I'll drag the anchor up
And rest assured, 'cause dreams don't turn to dust

Dreams don't turn to dust!

[Verse 2]
I made for the countryside
And my eyes never grew so wide
Apple raspberry river blue
I don't wanna leave without you
In the sound I gladly drowned
Into the emerald underground
I rub my eyes 'cause it's hard to see
Surrounded by all this beauty

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
(I'm sad to see you go)
(But I'd rather be alone)

When tiger eyes begin making you blush
And when diamonds boast that they can't be crushed
Let 'em go, 'cause dreams don't turn to dust

[Chorus]

Dreams don't turn to dust!
Dreams don't turn to dust!
And rest assured, 'cause dreams don't turn to dust!

===================


Don't remind me
That some days I'm a windshield
And other days I'm just a lucky bug
As cold iron rails leave
Old mossy trails through the countryside

The crow and the bean field
Are my best friends but
Boy, I need a hug (boy, I need a hug)
'Cause my heart stops without you
There's something about you
That makes me feel alive

If the green left the grass on the other side
(I would make like a tree and leave)
But if I reached for your hand
Would your eyes get wide?
(Who knew the other side could be so green?)

Don't remind me
I'm a chickadee in love with the sky
But that's clearly not a lot to crow about
'Cause when the stars silhouette me
I'm scared they'll forget me
And flicker out

I taste honey but I haven't seen the hive
Yeah I didn't look, I didn't even try
But still my heart stops without you
'Cause there's something about you
That makes me feel alive

If the green left the grass on the other side
(I would make like a tree and leave)
But if I reached for your hand
Would your eyes get wide?
(Who knew the other side could be so green?)

We are honey and the bee
Backyard of butterflies surrounded me
I fell in love with you
Like bees to honey
So let's up
And leave the weeping to the willow tree
And pour our tears in the sea

I swear there's a lot of vegetables out there
That crop up for air
And yet I never thought
We were two peas in a pod
Until you suddenly bloomed
Then I knew
That I'd always love you
(Oh, I'll always love you too)

If the green left the grass on the other side
(I would make like a tree and leave)
But if I reached for your hand
Would your eyes get wide?
(Who knew the other side could be so green?)
If the green left the grass on the other side
(I would make like a tree and leave)
But if I reached for your hand
Would your eyes get wide?
(Who knew the other side could be so green?)

And if I reached for your hand
For the rest of my life
(Who knew the other side could be so green?)

===================


The princess in her flower bed
Pulled the jungle underground
Where cherry bombs stain the blackbird's red
And explosions never make a sound

Oh, comet come down
Kamikaze over me
And I come alive
My midnight melody
Oh, comet come down

My captain on the snowy horse
Is coming back to take me home
(Is coming back to take me home)
He'll find me fighting back the terrible force
'Cause I'm not afraid to die alone

Oh, comet come down
Kamikaze over me
And I come alive
My midnight melody
Oh, comet come down
Kamikaze over me
And I come alive
My midnight melody
Oh, comet come down

Oh, comet come
(Oh, comet come down)
(down)

(Break down the open road)
Maybe I'll ride
(And fight back the undertow)
To save my life
(Bring in the ember glow)
Maybe I'll fly
(And go where you wanna go)
With an eagle eye

(Break down the open road)
Maybe I'll ride
(And fight back the undertow)
To save my life
(Bring in, bring in the ember glow)
Maybe I'll fly
(And go where you wanna go)
With an eagle eye
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)
(Eagle eye)

[Snippets from Ronald Reagan's Space Shuttle "Challenger" Tragedy Address:]

Ladies and Gentlemen, today is a day for mourning and remembering.
They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths,
And they had that special grace, that special spirit that says:
"Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy."
The crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God.

===================


Call back the cap com
Tick off the time bomb
Let felicity fly

Armor the air lock
Blanket the bed rock
And kiss the planet goodbye

Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark
But dear God, You're the only North Star
I would follow this far

Da da da da da dada da

Fight back the flight deck
Bring on the break neck
Cue the solar eclipse

Summit the sunset
Dovetail the dragnet
And blow your backbone to bits

Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark
But dear God, You're the only North Star
I would follow this far

Oh telescope
Keep an eye on my only hope
Lest I blink and get swept off the narrow road
Hercules, you've got nothing to say to me
'Cause you're not the blinding light that I need
For He is the saving grace of the galaxies (galaxies, galaxies, galaxies, galaxies)
He is the saving grace of the galaxies (galaxies)

Dear God, I was terribly lost
When the galaxies crossed
And the sun went dark
But dear God, You're the only North Star
I would follow this far

I would follow this far

(Through the galaxy)

I survived
A dreadful accident
In the car crash of the century
My shattered hopes
Collapsed on cold cement
But in the back of the ambulance
I never felt so content

A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight
To me
And now my vision can render the scene
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris
Happiness returned to me
Through a grave emergency

Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da

I tossed and turned
In sterile apathy
Until the violets
Arrived for me
The bouquet burst
And blossoms filled the room
And the place got smaller as they grew taller
And taught me to bloom

A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight
To me
And now my vision can render the scene
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris
Happiness returned to me
Through a grave emergency

The curtains decayed
The daylight poured in
I was never afraid
Of the darkness again
My burns were third-degree
But I'd been set free
Cuz grace had finally found its way
To me

A high-speed collision gave a new sense of sight
To me
And now my vision can render the scene
A blurry image of wreckage and roadside debris
Happiness returned to me
Happiness returned to me
Happiness returned to me
Through a grave emergency

Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da
(Through a grave emergency)
Da da da da
Da da da da
Happiness returned to me
Through a grave emergency

Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky
Even though, I'll never know what's up ahead
I'm never lettin' go, I'm never lettin' go

[Shawn Chrystopher - Rap Verse 1:]
Uh uh, that's not a plane, that's me
I'm sittin' where I'm supposed to
Floatin' on the cloud, can't nobody come close to
The concrete and the sky switch places
So now my ceiling is painted with cosmic spaces
Firecracker to the moon, keep your eyes shut
Blastin' off like a rocket from the ground up
Heh, I used to catch a cab on the Monday
Now the taxi's sellin' lights on the runway, fly high
Condo on the milky way
A house on the cloud and God's my landlord
And for my rent all I pay is my drive
Got that so If you need me you can find me in the alligator sky

Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead
I'm never lettin' go, I'm never lettin' go

Rollercoaster through the atmosphere
I'm drowning in this starry serenade
Where ecstasy becomes cavalier
My imagination's taking me away

Reverie whispered in my ear
I'm scared to death that I'll never be afraid
Rollercoaster through the atmosphere
My imagination's taking me away

[Shawn Chrystopher - Rap Verse 2:]
Uh, now I'mma dance like I never danced
Sing like I never sing, dream like I've never dreamed
Or-or tried to, 'cause we've been lied to
That the sun is somethin' that we can't fly to
Well, I sit on my star and see street lights
Look up, ha, you'll miss me if you blink twice
Imagination is high and if you got it you can meet me
When you see me in the alligator sky

Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead
I'm never lettin' go, I'm never lettin' go

Where was I when the rockets came to life (boom)
And carried you away into the alligator sky? (like a rocket from the ground up)
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead (never know)
I'm never lettin' go, I'm never lettin' go

Never letting go
In the alligator sky
In the alligator sky
In the alligator sky
In the alligator sky
Look up, ha, you'll miss me if you blink twice
In the alligator sky

(Da da da da da da da)
(Da da da da da da da)

My rock candy passion is bittersweet
And armed to the teeth
Cuz she would rather fall in chocolate
Than fall in love 
Especially with me

I stood under the waterfall
With a kiwi-pineapple parasol
As Cinderella dropped the crystal ball
And made a concrete cavern 
A caterpillar concert hall

I wish that we could sail our sad days away
Forever
In deep blue seas of paper mâché
(Let's dance in the moonlight)
A barracuda chased our dog days away
Forever
Let's sink or swim 'til we fall in love
(And dance in the moonlight)
When we join the yacht club

I would rather go swimming
With great white sharks
Than wade in romance
Cuz I can never find the courage
To ask her to dinner
Or even to dance
(Dance in the moonlight)

Don't sweat under your overcoat
Cuz my heart can harbor this paddle boat
You'll hit the bottom of the highest note
And the chatty tree frogs will never wanna
Leave your throat

I wish that we could sail our sad days away
Forever
In deep blue seas of paper mâché
(Let's dance in the moonlight)
A barracuda chased our dog days away
Forever
Let's sink or swim 'til we fall in love
(And dance in the moonlight)
When we join the yacht club

Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da

Let go of the world you know
And plug in the partyin' lights
Soak your cares in the solar flares
That light up these island nights
Orange eclipse I can taste your lips
In the citrus afternoon
If you can fly don't stop at the sky
Cuz there's footprints on the moon
(With you)

I wish that we could sail our sad days away
Forever
In deep blue seas of paper mâché
(Let's dance in the moonlight)
A barracuda chased our dog days away
Forever
Let's sink or swim 'til we fall in love
(And dance in the moonlight)
When we join the yacht club
(Let's dance in the moonlight)
When we join the yacht club

I saw a ghost on the stairs
And sheets on the tables and chairs
The silverware swam with the sharks in the sink
Even so, I don't know, what to think

I've been longing for
Daisies to push through the floor
And I wish plant life would grow all around me
So I won't feel dead anymore
So I won't feel dead anymore

I saw a bear in the den
Reading my textbooks again
Bats flowed like traffic as they poured from the attic
Heaven knows, I could really use a friend

I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings would you strum on mine?

I've been longing for
Daisies to push through the floor
I've never really felt like this before
And I wish plant life would grow all around me
So I won't feel dead anymore
So I won't feel dead anymore

Your spirit is sweet, so pull off your sheet
And give me a ghost of a smile
Show me your teeth, 'cause you're a teddy beneath
So just grin and bear it a while
Just grin and bear it a while

I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings would you strum on mine?

The brook babbles on about nothing at all
A new leaf turns over, unwilling to fall!

Tonight I'm busting out
Of this old haunted house
'Cause I'm sick of waiting for
All those spider webs to grow all around me
'Cause I don't feel dead anymore
And I'm not afraid anymore

I'd rather waltz than just walk through the forest
The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time
Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings would you strum on mine?
If I were to pluck on your heartstrings would you strum on mine?

June was the lobster shell
I dug by hand
A haven that hid me well
Beneath the sand
The wide windy waves washed in
But I stayed dry
The great breakers broke again
As I nodded off inside

And then
When the Empress ran aground
And my eyes turned blue and green
I heard a gorgeous sound
And that's when it became a dream

When the sky fell in
When the hurricanes came for me
I could finally crash again
And that's how I became the sea

I wrenched the engines off
And drank them down
The depths turned the iron soft
As they swiftly drowned
And I brought the ocean side
To its rusty knees
As I felt the even tide
Deep in my shallow dreams

And then
When the Empress ran aground
And my eyes turned blue and green
I heard a gorgeous sound
And that's when it became a dream
When the sky fell in
When the hurricanes came for me
I could finally crash again
And that's how I became the sea

When the sky fell in
(When the sky fell in)
(When the sky fell in)
When the hurricanes came for me
I could finally crash again
And that's how I became the sea
(How I became the sea)
That's how I became the sea
(How I became the sea)
That's how I became the sea
(How I became the sea)
(How I became the sea)

(When the sky fell in)
(When the hurricanes came for me)
(I could finally crash again)
(And that's how I became the sea)

(How I became the sea)

Symphony of silver tears,
Sing to me and sooth the ring in my ears,
Overcast these gloomy nights wear on,
But I'm holding fast because it's darkest just before the dawn.

I sang my princess fast asleep,
'Cause she was my dream come true,
Oh Annmarie, believe me, I loved you.

But now those lonely lullabies,
Just dampen my tired eyes,
Because I can't forget you.
Because I can't forget you.

I'll dissolve when the rain pours in,
When the nightmares take me,
I will scream with the howling wind,
'Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream.

Dizzy love turned a star lily pink,
And hung above our lids too flushed to blink,
But icy blue froze the fairytale cold,
Though I treasured you and you sparkled with someone to hold.

I sang my princess fast asleep,
'Cause she was my dream come true,
Oh Annmarie, believe me, I loved you.

But now those lonely lullabies,
Just dampen my tired eyes,
Because I can't forget you.
Because I can't forget you.

I'll dissolve when the rain pours in,
When the nightmares take me,
I will scream with the howling wind,
'Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream.

I'll dissolve when the rain pours in,
When the nightmares take me,
I will scream with the howling wind,
'Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream.
And I'd rather dream.

Annmarie, I'll never forget you.
Annmarie, I'll never forget you.
Annmarie, remember me?
I'll never forget you.
Annmarie, remember me?
I'll never forget you.
Annmarie, remember me?
I'll never forget you.

Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes

She dried my eyes and drifted off
While every tear was held aloft
The heavy rain clouds felt terrible
'Cause she made my stormy sky beautiful

Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes (Beautiful)
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes (Beautiful)
Light up the sky, shy violet angel eyes

Beautiful

'Cause she made my stormy sky beautiful.

Shipwreck in a sea of faces
There's a dreamy world up there
Dear friends in higher places
Carry me away from here

Travel light, let the sun eclipse you
'Cause your flight is about to leave
And there's more to this brave adventure
Than you'd ever believe

Birds-eye view, awake the stars 'cause they're all around you
Wide eyes will always brighten the blue
Chase your dreams, and remember me, sweet bravery
'Cause after all those wings will take you, up so high
So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind
And take to the sky (you take to the sky)

On the heels of war and wonder
There's a stormy world up there
You can't whisper above the thunder
But you can fly anywhere

Purple burst of paper birds
This picture paints a thousand words
So take a breath of myth and mystery
And don't look back

Birds-eye view, awake the stars 'cause they're all around you
Wide eyes will always brighten the blue
Chase your dreams, and remember me, sweet bravery
'Cause after all those wings will take you, up so high
So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind
And take to the sky (you take to the sky)

There's a realm above the trees
Where the lost are finally found
So touch your feathers to the breeze
And leave the ground

Birds-eye view, awake the stars 'cause they're all around you
Wide eyes will always brighten the blue
Chase your dreams, and remember me, sweet bravery
'Cause after all those wings will take you, up so high
So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind
And take to the sky
(you take to the sky) [2x]

===================


Close your tired eyes, relax and then
Count from 1 to 10 and open them
All these heavy thoughts will try to weigh you down
But not this time

Way up in the air, you're finally free
And you can stay up there right next to me
All this gravity will try to pull you down
But not this time

When the sun goes down and the lights burn out
Then it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are

Fill the darkest night with a brilliant light
'Cause it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are tonight

Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh

Brighter than a shooting star
Shine no matter where you are tonight

Gaze into my eyes when the fire starts
And fan the flames so hot it melts our hearts
Oh, the pouring rain will try to put it out
But not this time

Let your colors burn and brightly burst
Into a million sparks that all disperse
And illuminate a world that'll try to bring you down
But not this time

When the sun goes down and the lights burn out
Then it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are

Fill the darkest night with a brilliant light
'Cause it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are tonight

Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh

Brighter than a shooting star
Shine no matter where you are tonight

A thousand heart beats beat in time
It makes this dark planet come alive
So when the lights flicker out tonight
You gotta shine

When the sun goes down and the lights burn out
Then it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are

Fill the darkest night with a brilliant light
'Cause it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are tonight

Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh

Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are tonight.

(Dementia, you're driving me crazy
This is driving me crazy,
Dementia, dementia)

Every light in the night flickered in and out
Every bone in my back shivered up and down
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
'Cause this is driving me crazy

Every voice in my head shouted 'yes' and 'no'
Every freight train of thought fought to stop and go
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
'Cause this is driving me crazy

Big surprise, I'm a ghost keeping out of sight
Rub your eyes, you're a star in a summer night
This is love, this is war, it's insanity
Dementia, you're driving me crazy

(Dementia, you're driving me crazy,
This is driving me crazy)

Every tear in my eyes dripped and wouldn't drop
Every disc in my spine shook and couldn't stop
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
'Cause this is driving me crazy

Every hand let me go that I tried to hold
Every warm-hearted love left me freezing cold
Keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
'Cause this is driving me crazy

Big surprise, I'm a ghost keeping out of sight
Rub your eyes, you're a star in a summer night
This is love, this is war, it's insanity
Dementia, you're driving me crazy
(Dementia, you're driving me crazy)
(Dementia, you're driving me crazy)

This is driving me crazy

'Cause this is driving me crazy

Big surprise, I'm a ghost keeping out of sight
Rub your eyes, you're a star in a summer night
This is love, this is war, it's insanity
Dementia, dementia

Through the skies you're en route at the speed of light
So realize there's chaos in the air tonight
This is love, this is war, this is pure insanity
Dementia, you're driving me crazy

This is driving me crazy
Dementia, you're driving me crazy
'Cause this is driving me crazy
Dementia, you're driving me crazy
(This is driving me crazy)
(This is driving me crazy)
(This is driving me crazy)

===================


There was a shot in the dark, I was caught by surprise
There was a hole in my heart, there were tears in your eyes
And there was nothing to say 'cause you made up your mind
So I guess what you meant when you left was goodbye

So if you're gonna go and leave me in a lonely gray
I won't let it show until you've finally flown away

You gotta know that you tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away
You tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away

You were the one and it was enough
To be the one you were dreaming of
You were the one and we called it love
And now you take it all away, take it all away

I felt a pain in my chest with your kiss on my cheek
And as I try to digest the words I couldn't believe
I'm left with nothing to say with my heart on my sleeve
Making it easy to hurt and even harder to breathe

So if you're gonna go and leave me in a lonely gray
I won't let it show until you've finally flown away

You gotta know that you tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away
You tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away

You were the one and it was enough
To be the one you were dreaming of
You were the one and we called it love
And now you take it all away, take it all away

You take it all away, you take it all away, you take it all away

You gotta know that you tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away
You tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away

You were the one and it was enough
To be the one you were dreaming of
You were the one and we called it love
And now you take it all away, take it all away

===================


We were alone on the road driving faster
So far from home we were chasing disaster
Hard on the gas 'till the car caught on fire
We had to laugh as the smoked billowed higher
I wanna feel alive forever after
And you say, you say you wanna feel alive forever after
And I, and I, and I say

Follow the light through the dreams and disasters
Follow the light to the edge and the after
We won't turn around, we will not slow down
Follow the light through the dreams and disasters

Think of the sun, and the sound of it rising
Still on the run with our eyes on the horizon

I wanna feel alive forever after
And you say, you say you wanna feel alive forever after
And I, and I, and I say

Follow the light through the dreams and disasters
Follow the light to the edge and the after
We won't turn around, we will not slow down
Follow the light through the dreams and disasters

I just wanna feel alive
I just wanna feel alive
I just wanna feel alive
I just wanna feel alive

Follow the light through the dreams and disasters
Follow the light to the edge and the after
We won't turn around, we will not slow down
Follow the light through the dreams and disasters!
We won't turn around, we will not slow down
Follow the light through the dreams and disasters!

I saw your face in a criminal sketch
Don't be alarmed 'cause you don't know me yet
I'm on the prowl now, sniffing around this town for you
Calling all cars, there's an officer down
Shot to the heart on the night on the town, and
The evidence of your fingerprints was found, and now

You got the right to remain right here with me
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit
Love is a high speed chase racing down the street

Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you
Woo-oo woo-oo woo, I'm coming after you

Oh no, here we go once again
We both know you'll never turn yourself in
So I'm driving 'till it's light out, searching for your hideout
(Driving 'till it's light out, searching for your hideout)
Pick up the pace as I chase you around
One of these days I'll end up tracking you down
But yeah, I've got the feeling I'll be letting you loose when I do

Because you, you got the right to remain right here with me
I'm on your tail in a hot pursuit
Love is a high speed chase racing down the street

Whoa-uh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-uh-oh
It's always a good time

Woke up on the right side of the bed
What's up with this Prince song inside my head?
Hands up if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time

Slept in all my clothes like I didn't care
Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere
I'm in if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time

Good morning and good night
I'll wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time (Whooo)

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time

Freaked out, dropped my phone in the pool again
Checked out of my room, hit the ATM
Let's hang out if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time

Good morning and good night
I'll wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time (Whooo)

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time

Doesn't matter when
It's always a good time then
Doesn't matter where
It's always a good time there

Doesn't matter when
It's always a good time then

It's always a good time

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time

===================


There were days when each hour was a war I fought to survive
There were nights full of nightmares and I dreaded closing my eyes
There were skies that burst open with a downpour to drown me alive
But the world took a spark like a match in the dark
And the fire brought me to life

So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high
'Cause theres no other way we can stay alive

'Cause we're burning bright
As we all unite
And when it's all said and done
We'll shine like the sun
So don't let the fire die
And we'll watch the sky
As it fills with light
And though the embers are new
Whatever you do, just don't let the fire die

And you'll find there'll be mornings
When the ashes and embers are cold
But you'll fight with a passion
And you'll never stop 'cause you know
Yeah you know, it gets better
And your story is yet to be told
Every push, every shove, every war, every love
Yeah, the coals are beginning to glow

So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high
'Cause theres no other way we can stay alive

'Cause we're burning bright
As we all unite
And when it's all said and done
We'll shine like the sun
So don't let the fire die
And we'll watch the sky
As it fills with light
And though the embers are new
Whatever you do, just don't let the fire die

Don't let the fire die
It gets better
Just don't let the fire die, no

'Cause we're burning bright (burning bright)
As we all unite
And when it's all said and done
We'll shine like the sun
So don't let the fire die
And we'll watch the sky (watch the sky)
As it fills with light
And though the embers are new
Whatever you do, just don't let the fire die

And though the embers are new
Whatever you do, just don't let the fire die
Don't let the fire die.

===================


I'm tired of waking up in tears
'Cause I can't put to bed these phobias and fears
I'm new to this grief I can't explain
But I'm no stranger to the heartache and the pain

The fire I began is burning me alive
But I know better than to leave and let it die

I'm a silhouette asking every now and then
"Is it over yet? Will I ever feel again?"
I'm a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on, the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home

I'm sick of the past I can't erase
A jumble of footprints and hasty steps I can't retrace
The mountain of things I still regret
Is a vile reminder that I would rather just forget (no matter where I go)

The fire I began is burning me alive
But I know better than to leave and let it die

I'm a silhouette asking every now and then (now and then)
"Is it over yet? Will I ever smile again?"
I'm a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on, the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home

'Cause I walk alone
No matter where I go
'Cause I walk alone
No matter where I go
'Cause I walk alone
No matter where I go

I'm a silhouette asking every now and then (now and then)
"Is it over yet? Will I ever love again?"
I'm a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
But the more I try to move on, the more I feel alone
So I watch the summer stars to lead me home

I watch the summer stars to lead me home.

===================


Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I left my heart in metropolis

So far apart, I checked but the coast was clear
I feel like a postcard
I wish you were here

Subway through the dark, carriage through the park
Taxi down the street, get out and use my feet
Don't matter much to me what it is that I do
As long as I'm coming home to you

Oh oh oh, as far as I can see
You're the only one, the only one who can get to me
Like a hijacked plane or a runaway train
Or a speeding bullet, there's no stopping this
I left my heart in metropolis

A thousand miles feels like a million years
Like hundreds of postcards that say 
I wish you were here (I can't even take it in)
Airplane through the sky, greyhound racing by
Dirt bike on the beach, sailboat on the sea
Don't matter much to me what it is that I do
As long as I'm coming home to you

Oh oh oh, as far as I can see
You're the only one, the only one who can get to me
Like a hijacked plane or a runaway train
Or a speeding bullet, there's no stopping this
I left my heart in metropolis
I left my heart in metropolis

Like a hijacked plane or a runaway train
Or a speeding bullet, there's no stopping this
I left my heart in metropolis
I left my heart in metropolis
I left my heart in metropolis
I left my heart in metropolis

Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I left my heart in metropolis.

===================


There was a shot in the dark, I was caught by surprise
There was a hole in my heart, there were tears in your eyes
And there was nothing to say 'cause you made up your mind
So I guess what you meant when you left was goodbye

So if you're gonna go and leave me in a lonely gray
I won't let it show until you've finally flown away

You gotta know that you tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away
You tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away

You were the one and it was enough
To be the one you were dreaming of
You were the one and we called it love
And now you take it all away, take it all away

I felt a pain in my chest with your kiss on my cheek
And as I try to digest the words I couldn't believe
I'm left with nothing to say with my heart on my sleeve
Making it easy to hurt and even harder to breathe

So if you're gonna go and leave me in a lonely gray
I won't let it show until you've finally flown away

You gotta know that you tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away
You tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away

You were the one and it was enough
To be the one you were dreaming of
You were the one and we called it love
And now you take it all away, take it all away

You take it all away, you take it all away, you take it all away

You gotta know that you tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away
You tear me up when you say
You wanna take it all away, take it all away

You were the one and it was enough
To be the one you were dreaming of
You were the one and we called it love
And now you take it all away, take it all away

That blonde, she's a bomb, she's an atom bomb.
Rigged up, and ready to drop!
Bad news, I'm a fuse, and I've met my match.
So stand back, it's about to go off!

A spark soaring down through the pouring rain
And restoring life to the lighthouse
A slow motion wave on the ocean
Stirs my emotion up like a rain cloud

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

A cab driver turned to skydiver
Then to survivor,
Dying to breakdown
A blood brother, surrogate mother
Hugging each other, crying their eyes out

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

I'm ecstatic like a drug addict
Locked in the attic
Strung out and spellbound

I fought all through the night
Oh, oh, but I made it alive
The sun's starting to rise
Oh, oh, these are beautiful times
This fight of my life is so hard, so hard, so hard
But I'm gonna survive
Oh, oh, these are beautiful times

A bad feeling burned through the ceiling
Leaving my healing heart with a new scar
A dead fire rose and rose higher
Like a vampire, up from the graveyard

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

We all suffer but we recover
Just to discover life where we all are

I fought all through the night
Oh, oh, but I made it alive
The sun's starting to rise
Oh, oh, these are beautiful times
This fight of my life is so hard, so hard, so hard
But I'm gonna survive
Oh, oh, these are beautiful times

This fight of my life is so hard, so hard, so hard
But I'm gonna survive
Oh, oh, these are beautiful times

My heart's burning bad
And it's turning black
But I'm learning how to be stronger
And sincerely, I love you dearly
Oh, but I'm clearly destined to wander

===================


I fell in love with a ghost
Out, under the moonlight
You took my hand and held me close
For once I was alright

I cried and the tears fell from my eyes
Like a waterfall
And I swear I could feel you in my arms
But there was no one there at all

You were my clarity, I swear
All alone in a daydream
Yeah there was magic in the air
And you were right here beside me
Held down like an angel with no wings
I wanna fly again
I just can't get you off my mind
And now I'm gonna be up all night
Whoa oh oh oh

It's tearing me up inside
I just can't get you off my mind

I tossed and turned in the end
With no one to talk to
I searched again and again
But I never found you

I cried and the tears fell from my eyes
Like a waterfall
And I swear I could feel you in my arms
But there was no one there at all

You were my clarity, I swear
All alone in a daydream
Yeah there was magic in the air
And you were right here beside me
Held down like an angel with no wings
I wanna fly again
I just can't get you off my mind
And now I'm gonna be up all night
Whoa oh oh oh

I'm gonna be up all night, whoa oh oh oh
I'm gonna be up all night
I don't wanna say goodbye
Its tearing me up inside
I just can't get you off my mind
And now I'm gonna be up all night

Whoa oh oh oh
I'm gonna be up all night, whoa oh oh oh
I'm gonna be up all night
I don't wanna say goodbye
Its tearing me up inside
I just can't get you off my mind

You were my clarity, I swear
All alone in a daydream
Yeah there was magic in the air
And you were right here beside me
Held down like an angel with no wings
I wanna fly again
I just can't get you off my mind
And now I'm gonna be up all night

(Gonna be up all night)
(And now I'm gonna be up all night)

A whisper on the air
Made my heart rate fall
When I heard you call
And I swear, I could hear your voice in my ear
But there was no one there at all

===================


An eight year old girl had a panic attack
'Cause the father she loved left and never looked back
No longer the hero she counted on
He told her he loved her and then he was gone

She tried to look happy in front of her friends
But knew that she'd never feel normal again
She fought back the tears as they filled her eyes
And wanted him back just to tell him goodbye

When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out
This isn't the end

Her dad was a good guy that everyone liked
But nobody knew he was dying inside
He promised his family he'd be alright
And then with a gunshot he left them behind

When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out
This isn't the end

When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out
This isn't the end, no.

The role of a father he never deserved
He abandoned his daughter and never returned
And over the years though the pain was real
She finally forgave him and started to heal

How close is the ending, well, nobody knows
The future's a mystery and anything goes
Love is confusing and life is hard
You fight to survive 'cause you made it this far

It's all too astounding to comprehend
It's just the beginning this isn't the end
It's just the beginning this isn't the end

===================


It's another bad dream
Poison in my blood stream
I'm dying but I can't scream
Will you show me the way?

It's another wolf bite
Howlin' in the moonlight
I wanna get my life right!
Will you show me the way?
Tonight

Will you be there?
Toni-i-ight, toni-i-ight, i-ight
Ohwoho

[Chorus:]
If the darkness falls, and my angel calls
In my despair
Will you be there?
In the darkest night
When I need your light
Will you show me the way?
If my time runs out
And the sky falls down
Despite my fear
Will you appear?
If the world goes blind
And I lose my mind
Will you show me the way?
Tonight

Will you show me the way, tonight?
Will you show me the way, tonight?

It's another nightmare
I swear there's something out there
So save me cause I'm so scared
Will you show me the way?

It's another werewolf
All dressed up in sheep's wool
And changing when the moon's full
Will you show me the way?

[Chorus x2:]
If the darkness falls, and my angel calls
In my despair
Will you be there?
In the darkest night
When I need your light
Will you show me the way?
If my time runs out
And the sky falls down
Despite my fear
Will you appear?
If the world goes blind
And I lose my mind
Will you show me the way?
Tonight

In my despair
Will you be there?
Tonight

===================


I ain't too sure what I believe in
But I believe in what I see
And when I close my eyes
I see my whole life ahead of me

These are our hours (These are our hours)
This is our time (This is our time)
This is our time
These are our hours (These are our hours)
Out on the verge (Out on the verge)
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives (The rest of our lives)

Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight
Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight
Edge of the earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives

These are our hours (These are our hours)
This is our time (This is our time)
These are our hours (These are our hours)
Out on the verge
Out on the verge
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives

Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight
Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight
Edge of the earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives

(For the rest of our lives)

From now on
There's no looking back
Full steam ahead
On this one-way track

From this day forward
I will make a promise
To be true to myself
And always be honest

For the rest of my life
I will do what's right
I will do what's right
When I step...

Out on the verge of the rest of our lives tonight
Top of the world and we're dressed to the nines tonight
Edge of the earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives (The rest of our lives)

The rest of our lives
Edge of the earth and we're touching the sky tonight
Out on the verge of the rest of our lives

I was so young and reckless
It was all a blur but there you were
And your love left me breathless
When the fairy dust fell over us
Yeah I, I felt like I could fly
Cause I, I found love

So take my hand, and shed a tear
Before I'm gone, it's now or never
I'll hold you close, the end is near
But love goes on, and on forever

It's so dark in my mind
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'm so bad, at goodbyes
I hold my breath, and close my eyes
I don't have a lot left
Oh, how did it end so fast?
I say, with my last breath
It's a perfect day, to float away

When the sparks, flew between us
I saw you glow, and had to know
Where our journey would lead us
Til' the story end, and back again
Yeah I, I felt like I could fly
Cause I, I found love

So lead me home, and lift me up
Above the stars, and even higher
I'm not afraid, because your love
It falls like rain, and burns like fire

It's so dark in my mind
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'm so bad, at goodbyes
I hold my breath, and close my eyes
I don't have a lot left
Oh, how did it end so fast?
I say, with my last breath
It's a perfect day, to float away

I'll love you forever
And you were my dream come true
I say, with my last breath
It's a perfect day, to float away
Yeah I, I felt like I could fly
Cause I, I found love

===================


[Owl City:]
I feel you glowing in the dark
When I collapse into your arms
I'm just a stranger in the stars

[Sarah Russell:]
Cause somehow it seems when I am with you
That all of my dreams begin to come true
And carefully you carry me away

[Owl City:]
I've never felt so wide awake
Cause I'm wonder struck
I love how you take my breath away
I'm thunderstruck
To tell you the truth, I'm so afraid
(I'm so afraid)
That I'm out of luck
I love how you take my breath away
(Take my breath away)
I'm thunderstruck

[Owl City:]
I chase the phantoms down the hall
I felt the floorboards rise and fall
I lost and never loved at all

[Sarah Russell:]
Cause I'm in a daze and you're in my dreams
The orchestra plays the prettiest things
And carefully you carry me away

[Owl City:]
I've never felt so wide awake
Cause I'm wonder struck

[Owl City (Sarah Russell):]
Woah, I'm leaving the world behind
(And all my dreams,
All of my dreams are shared now)
Woah, I'm over the moon tonight

All of my dreams are shared now)
Cause somehow it seems (when I am with you)
That all of my dreams (begin to come true)
And carefully you carry me away

[Sarah Russell (Owl City):]
You take my breath away
(Away)
When I'm with you

And all my dreams,
All of my dreams are shared now

All of my dreams are shared now
(When I look at you)

===================


When my hope is lost
And my strength is gone
I run to you and you alone
When I can't get up and I can't go on
I run to you and you alone

'Cause you're my light in the dark
And I sing with all of my heart

Hallelujah
My almighty God divine
Hallelujah
I am yours and you are mine
This is all I know how to say
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
You're my everything

When I'm plagued with pain
And filled with fear

And death is near
I run to you and you alone

And I sing with all of my heart

Hallelujah
My almighty God divine
Hallelujah
I am yours and you are mine
This is all I know how to say

When trouble comes and goes
And when the cold wind blows
I lift my hands up, I lift my hands up
When sorrow knocks me down
And you pick me off the ground
I lift my hands up, I lift my hands up
And I sing

Hallelujah
My almighty God divine
Hallelujah
I am yours and you are mine
This is all I know how to say

Hallelujah
By the grace of God above
Hallelujah
I'll shine a light 'cause I am loved
This is all I know I will say

Hallelujah
You're my everything

Ohh Ohh, You're my everything

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

When I was a kid I saved up all my dough so I could buy C-3PO
Put Mentos in my Diet Coke in the backseat of the bus
When I was a kid I ate Spaghetti-Os, played laser tag and G.I. Joes
And if you vowed "no girls allowed, " then you could join the club
When I was a kid I spent my Saturdays
Blowin' on Nintendo games
The newest thing was "Lion King, " and I could feel the love

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

[Hanson:]
When I was a kid I dreamed of Power Wheels
Stayed up late watching action films
And I won't lie, my friends and I, were too legit to quit
When I was a kid I lived for climbing trees, ate Dr. Pepper jellybeans
My favorite part of "Jurassic Park" was how real the raptors looked
When I was a kid I still had VHS, watched Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff
Zack Morris owned the first cell phone, and it was off the hook!

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

Gak, Pogs, and Floam, and "Home Alone, " "Berenstein Bears" and bean bag chairs
My L.A. Looks and Goosebumps books, oh Etch-a-Sketch
What happens next?
Grape Juicy Juice and Dr. Seuss, piggy-back rides and
Slip 'N Slides, McDonald's fries, those were the best
What happens next?

It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, those were the days oh-oh

It's unbelievable
When I think back I'm amazed
It's unbelievable
Cause baby those were the days
It's unbelievable
It ruled in so many ways
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

(It's so amazes)
(Those were the days!)

===================


So I walk alone down the darkest roads
'Cause I've always known how the story goes
When the curtain falls, I'll be wearing thin
Clawing at the walls as they're closing in
In this twisted plot I was destined for
I'm an astronaut on the ocean floor
So misunderstood 'till the bloody end
How I wish I could do it all again

It feels like I'm a lone survivor
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world
And on my own I walk alone
To see the sun again I'd give anything
But life demands a final chapter
A story that we all must leave behind
It's do or die, and this is mine
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing

It's another night of the living dead
Like a viper bite in a spiderweb
It's so deathly dark in the alleyway
And a bleeding heart makes you easy prey
I would run and hide for the afternoon
With the butterfly in the panic room
Though I won't be missed, I would say it's time
For a different twist in the story line

It feels like I'm a lone survivor
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world
And on my own I walk alone
To see the sun again I'd give anything
But life demands a final chapter
A story that we all must leave behind
It's do or die, and this is mine
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing

It feels like I'm a lone survivor
Forgotten in a dark and deadly world
And on my own I walk alone
To see the sun again I'd give anything
But life demands a final chapter
A story that we all must leave behind
It's do or die, and this is mine
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing
The anthem of a bird with a broken wing

Tell the world I know that my mind is made
It's a horror show, but I'm not afraid
Though I won't be missed, I would say it's time
For a different twist in the story line

[Owl City:]
I'm saying goodbye to the skyline
Hello to the sweet pines
Gonna see you later street lights
I'm headed back to tree lines
To free time and starry nights
To bonfires and fire flies
Pack your bags it's time to go
Cause we got brighter lights back home

[Jake Owen:]
I've got aching feet
From walking over miles of concrete
And I can't wait to dream
But the city, you know she won't go to sleep
So I'm saying...

[Owl City:]
Goodbye to the skyline
Hello to the sweet pines
Gonna see you later street lights
I'm headed back to tree lines
To free time and starry nights
To bonfires and fire flies
Pack your bags it's time to go
Cause we got brighter lights back home
Yeah, we got brighter lights

[Jake Owen:]
Back home there's a girl named Mary Lou
A diner off the highway with a corner booth
And every gravel road is a trip down memory lane
And back home, where the corn grows ten feet tall
Every year's measured on the pantry wall
The willow trees are waving 'til we come back home again

[Owl City (Jake Owen):]
I'm saying goodbye to the skyline
Hello to the sweet pines
Gonna see you later street lights
I'm headed back to tree lines
(To free time and starry nights
To bonfires and fire flies
Pack your bags it's time to go)
Pack your bags it's time to go

All the thoughts in my head spinning 'round like a hurricane
And life leaves me so confused
When I trip and I fall I collapse like a tidal wave
So I'm crying out to you

You reached down out of nowhere
And picked my heart up off the floor
You put my life back together
And I'm not broken anymore

You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: Will you come to my rescue?
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without you
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh) I can't live without you
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh) I just can't live without you

When I'm hit like a hook to the jaw in a title fight
I'm down and I'm knocked out cold, you know
And with my heart broke apart like a wreck in a shallow tide
Yeah I've never felt this low

You reached down out of nowhere
And picked my heart up off the floor
You put my life back together
And I'm not broken anymore

You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: Will you come to my rescue?
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without you
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh) I can't live without you
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh) I just can't live without you
You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: Will you come to my rescue?
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without you
You're my only wish for a dream come true
And it goes like this: Will you come to my rescue?
You're the only hope that I'm clinging to
And I hope you know I can't live without you

[Adam:]
Some days I barely hold on
When life drags me down
I wanna let go
But when my spirit is weak
You come to my aid
And strengthen my soul

I'm lost without You
I'll never doubt You
Your grace is beyond compare
And though when it rains, it pours
You know all I have is Yours
You smile when you hear my prayer

You rescued me and I believe
That God is love and He is all I need
From this day forth for all eternity
I'll never wander on my own
For I am Yours until you call me home
I close my eyes and I can hear You say
You're not alone!
You're not alone!

[Britt:]
Some days I just can't go on
I stumble and fall
And I hang my head
But You reach out for my hand
And You lift me up
Again and again
Oh, yes, You do

[Both:]
I'm lost without You
I'll never doubt You
Your grace is beyond compare
And though when it rains, it pours
You know all I have is Yours
You smile when you hear my prayer
You rescued me and I believe
That God is love and He is all I need
From this day forth for all eternity
I'll never wander on my own
For I am Yours until you call me home
I close my eyes and I can hear You say
You're not alone!
You're not alone!

[Adam:]
In the face of my depravity

[Britt:]
For God so loved the world He taught for me
Yeah

[Both:]
My fire burns ‘til He returns
And takes me home beyond the galaxy

[Britt:]
You rescued me and I believe
That God is love and He is all I need
From this day forth for all eternity

[Adam:]
All eternity!

[Both:]
I'll never wander on my own
For I am Yours until you call me home
I close my eyes and I can hear You say
You're not alone!
You're not alone!

[Britt:]
You're not
You're not alone
Never alone...

An eight year old girl had a panic attack
'Cause the father she loved left and never looked back
No longer the hero she counted on
He told her he loved her and then he was gone

She tried to look happy in front of her friends
But knew that she'd never feel normal again
She fought back the tears as they filled her eyes
And wanted him back just to tell him goodbye

When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out
This isn't the end

Her dad was a good guy that everyone liked
But nobody knew he was dying inside
He promised his family he'd be alright
And then with a gunshot he left them behind

When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out
This isn't the end

When the rain falls down
When it all turns around
When the light goes out
This isn't the end, no.

The role of a father he never deserved
He abandoned his daughter and never returned
And over the years though the pain was real
She finally forgave him and started to heal

How close is the ending, well, nobody knows
The future's a mystery and anything goes
Love is confusing and life is hard
You fight to survive 'cause you made it this far

It's all too astounding to comprehend
It's just the beginning this isn't the end
It's just the beginning this isn't the end

===================


Feels like I've been away for a thousand years
So tired of these airports and souvenirs
I shiver in the night and I think of you 

I stroll the boulevards
I stare up at the stars
And wish they'd all align (when I'm in Tokyo)
You keep me on my toes 
And this is how it goes 
You never leave my mind 

Are you having fun yet?
I'll send you the sunset 
I love the most
When I'm in Tokyo
I'll melt in the moonlight
And follow the shoreline
On down the coast
When I'm in Tokyo
Oooh, can't sleep the whole night through
Oooh, when I am missing you
I'm thinking it out loud
I wish I could reach out
And hold you close
When I'm in Tokyo

I wander all alone in the pouring rain
Ride shotgun on the wind in a bullet train
I shiver in the night and I think of you

I stroll the boulevards
I stare up at the stars
And wish they'd all align 
You keep me on my toes 
And this is how it goes 
You never leave my mind 

Are you having fun yet?
I'll send you the sunset 
I love the most
When I'm in Tokyo
I'll melt in the moonlight
And follow the shoreline
On down the coast
When I'm in Tokyo
Oooh, can't sleep the whole night through
Oooh, when I am missing you
I'm thinking it out loud
I wish I could reach out
And hold you close
When I'm in Tokyo

I stroll the boulevards
I stare up at the stars
And wish they'd all align 
You keep me on my toes 
And this is how it goes 
You never leave my mind 

Are you having fun yet?
I'll send you the sunset 
I love the most

I'll melt in the moonlight
And follow the shoreline
On down the coast

Oooh, can't sleep the whole night through
Oooh, when I am missing you
I'm thinking it out loud
I wish I could reach out
And hold you close
When I'm in Tokyo (When I'm in Tokyo)

When I'm in Tokyo (When I'm in Tokyo)

When I'm in Tokyo (When I'm in Tokyo)

When I'm in Tokyo (When I'm in Tokyo)

When I'm in Tokyo (When I'm in Tokyo)

Got an email at 22
Told me I could be a star
On a plane for the first time
I couldn't wait to start

Landed at JFK
Father Christmas picked me up
Checked in to a dream hotel
And I thought "There's no such thing as luck"

I walked in to my interview
And I thought "There's no such thing as luck"
And oh, if I only knew then what I know now
I'd stand like a one man band
And I'd say "All this is new to me, but here's how it's gonna be"

And I'd say "Hey, there is more to me than meets the eye
Let me be who I wanna be"
And I'd say "Hey, I'm an oddity and that's alright
Let me fly and follow my dreams"

And I'd say "Hey, thanks for the weekend
A good time was had by all"
And I'd say "Hey, thanks for the weekend
I ain't a smooth talker but thanks for the Fiji Water"

Thanks for the Fiji Water

Dinner under a palmtree
I had so much on my mind
Amazed by the bright lights
I stayed up half the night

And boy, I took a leap of faith
With nowhere else to go but up
I walked in to my interview
And I thought "There's no such thing as luck"

And oh, if I only knew then what I know now
I'd stand like a one man band
And I'd say "All this is new to me, but here's how it's gonna be

And I'd say "Hey, there is more to me than meets the eye
Let me be who I wanna be"
And I'd say "Hey, I'm an oddity and that's alright
Let me fly and follow my dreams"

And I'd say "Hey, thanks for the weekend
A good time was had by all"
And I'd say "Hey, thanks for the weekend
I ain't a spindoctor but thanks for the offer"

And "By the way, hey, thanks for the weekend"
(cause no one does it like you do)
"You know I had a ball"
(it was nice to meet you)
And I'd say "Hey, thanks for the weekend
I ain't a smooth talker but thanks for the Fiji Water"

Thanks for the Fiji Water

I laughed when I got back home and I thought
"There's no such thing as luck"

My mum woke my dad up
And said "it's time to leave"
So they jumped in the old Caprice
And tore off into the night
On the 4th of July

They flew through the darkness
Driving like Jehu
And they rolled into Ottumwa
Before the sun begun to rise
On the 4th of July

And in walks Bob and Janice
Rachel's on her way
To peek in through the window
Hoping to hear her grandson cry
On the 4th of July

My mother watched the fireworks
From her hospital bed
And after it was all over
She held me for the first time
On the 5th of July

I've got my mother's brown eyes
And my dad's quiet way
And Grandma Rachel's love for music
The morning I arrived
On the 5th of July

Deeping in Iowa country
And a heavenly hideaway
On the shores of Lake Rathbun
My folks brought me home
On the 5th of July

That was when (that was when)
Life began (life began)
For me
That was when (that was when)
Life began (life began)
For me

A teacher and a mechanic
Brought me into this world
They loved me with all their hearts since
The day I opened my eyes
On the 5th of July

That was when (that was when)
Life began (life began)
For me
That was when (that was when)
Life began (life began)
For me

===================


It's been this way from the start
It's like they're always trying to tear us apart
But we will stand strong, stand true
And everybody's gonna watch what we do
And they'll be awestruck saying aw shucks
They either got real good or they got real good luck

And I'd be lying if I said that I could take any more
Cause I've been on my own, trying like never before
And I was lying on the couch and there's this knock on the door
And it's like

All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say
Oh yeah
Lemme hear you say yeah

Another day, another chance
We got our card and we're going to the dance
We're gonna stay strong, hold true
And everybody's gonna watch what we do
And they'll be awestruck, saying aw shucks
They either got real good or they got real good luck

And I'd be lying if I said that we could take any more
Cause we're about to light a fire like never before
And if you're lying on the couch and there's a knock on the door
It's like

All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say
Oh yeah

All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say
Oh yeah
Lemme hear you say yeah

We'll always be young at heart
And nothing's ever gonna tear us apart
Because we stand strong, stand true
And everybody's gonna watch what we do
And they'll be awestruck saying aw shucks
They either got real good or you know what

All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say

All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say
Oh yeah
Lemme hear you say yeah

I'm a house wren hunting for a house
I haven't found one, I'm on the lookout
For a home to call my own
A private residence
Through the grapevine I heard an empty gourd
Is hanging up somewhere on some old lady's porch
I'll pack my bags and off I'll go
To my new humble abode

I'm gonna sing
At the top of my lungs
'Cause it's a beautiful day
I'm gonna spread my wings
'Cause as far as I know
I am halfway home

I'm a house wren who needs a summer home
A country farm house or a quiet bungalow
Not too big, and not too small
First-rate real estate
I got my eyes peeled for a window box
An old tin can, a boot or a flower pot
I'll pack my bags and off I'll go
To my new humble abode

I'm gonna sing
At the top of my lungs
'Cause it's a beautiful day
I'm gonna spread my wings
'Cause as far as I know
I am half way home

I'm a house wren still hunting for a house
But I got a song and a lot to sing about
I'll pack my bags and off I'll go (off I'll go)
Because you know

I'm gonna sing
At the top of my lungs
'Cause it's a beautiful day
I'm gonna spread my wings
I'm on top of the world
And it's a beautiful thing

I'm gonna sing
At the top of my lungs
'Cause it's a beautiful day
I'm gonna spread my wings
'Cause as far as I know
I am half way home

I am half way home

He doesn't fight crime or wear a cape
He doesn't read minds or levitate
But every time my world needs saving, he's my superman
Some folks don't believe in heroes 'cause they haven't met my dad

He loves his workshop and rock and roll
He's got a hot rod and a heart of gold
And you could say he's a man of few words, but he talks a lot within
And even though I'm a little taller, I still look up to him

He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive, and to fight, and to dream
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see
That my dad's a hero to me

Rust-ridden fenders, and doors full of dings
Somehow he can fix about anything
I didn't think he knew how to cry till our dog died that year
He doesn't always say I love you, but I can hear him loud and clear

He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive, and to fight, and to dream
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see
That my dad's a hero to me

He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive, and to fight, and to dream
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see
That my dad's a hero to me

My dad's a hero to me
My dad's a hero to me

===================


A fifteen year old kid from Saint Paul
Hopped on a train and headed west
Got a job at a Saint Mary restaurant
Washing dishes and making friends

The years went by like the seasons
And they brought him a lifetime of joy
He bought ten or twelve acres of heaven
With a paradise vantage point

And he built a cabin at the foot of the mountains
That stole his heart when he was a boy

On North Fork Road you're almost home

Get lost in Montana
Where your heart can finally roam
Get lost in Montana
Where the mountains call you home
Get lost forever in Montana

His son worked hard in West Glacier
His daughter sold souvenirs
And he always went back to Polebridge
With his family every year

To his green tin roof in the Rockies
And his sky so full of stars
His spirit lives in these mountains
Where Montana first stole his heart

On North Fork Road you're almost home

Get lost in Montana
Where your heart can finally roam
Get lost in Montana
Where the mountains call you home
Get lost forever in Montana

Two words on a bumper sticker
Were all I needed to read
I found myself for the first time
When Montana enchanted me

So get lost in the Big Sky country
Where adventure calls your name
Every moment is worth more than diamonds
When you spend time in the treasure state

So get lost in the Big Sky country
And let your heart lead the way

===================


I am a light sleeper
But I am a heavy dreamer
My imagination gives me wings
And I can go anywhere

And when I wander away, to some other place
I'm suddenly there, way up in the air
Where passenger trains catch fire and fill the sky with flames
And that black rabbit of death
Wakes up in a breath, of beautiful dreams
My heartache it seems, so terribly vain
Where fire and diamonds fall like rain

Do you believe in endless miracles?
Do you believe in the impossible?
Do you believe sleep is a time machine?
Do you believe in curiosity?
Do you believe in what you cannot see?
Do you believe life is a Lucid Dream?

Well that's how you study the stars
That's how you study the stars
And that's how you know them by heart
Life is a Lucid Dream

Such is the path of a dreamer
I find my way by moonlight
My imagination gives me wings
And I can go anywhere

And when I wander away, to some other place
I'm suddenly there, way up in the air
Where passenger trains catch fire and fill the sky with flames
And that black rabbit of death
Wakes up in a breath, of beautiful dreams
My heartache it seems, so terribly vain
Where fire and diamonds fall like rain

Do you believe in endless miracles?
Do you believe in the impossible?
Do you believe sleep is a time machine?
Do you believe in curiosity?
Do you believe in what you cannot see?
Do you believe life is a Lucid Dream?

Well that's how you study the stars
That's how you study the stars
And that's how you know them by heart
Life is a Lucid Dream
Well that's how you study the stars
That's how you study the stars
And that's how you know them by heart
Life is a Lucid Dream

I am a light sleeper
But I am a heavy dreamer

===================


When the road is long
And your strength is gone
Remember I am just a prayer away
When the way is hard
And you are faint of heart
Remember I am just a prayer away

Hold fast, I'll guide you through the night
And fear not for I am by your side

Listen through the rain
And you can hear the angels say
Help is on the way
The moment you begin to pray
When the thunders roar
You don't need to be afraid
I'll lead you through the storm
So please remember when I say
I'm with you always

When you are worn out
And you are let down
Remember I am just a prayer away
When every door is locked
And you feel so lost
Remember I am just a prayer away

Hold fast, I'll guide you through the night
And fear not for I am by your side

Listen through the rain
And you can hear the angels say
Help is on the way
The moment you begin to pray
When the thunders roar
You don't need to be afraid
I'll lead you through the storm
So please remember when I say
I'm with you always

Come and walk with me, yeah
Come and talk with me, yeah
Soar on eagles' wings
Run and I'll be there

Listen through the rain
And you can hear the angels say
Help is on the way
The moment you begin to pray
When the thunders roar
You don't need to be afraid
I'll lead you through the storm
So please remember when I say
I'm with you always
I'm with you always

Pull the moon down with a lasso
Make your ceiling full of stars glow
I can sneak in through the window
And I could say it but we both know
You got me floatin' on cloud nine

Look up when the world gets you down
And you're gonna get by
Hang in when the world counts you out
And you're gonna be fine
Sometimes that's life, some days nothing ever goes right
But when your hand is in mine
You got me floatin' on cloud nine

Meet the one who makes your heart stop
Find a diamond in a gift shop
Live a little, love a whole lot
And you'll be shouting from the rooftop
You got me floatin' on cloud nine

Look up when the world gets you down
And you're gonna get by
Hang in when the world counts you out
And you're gonna be fine
Sometimes that's life, some days nothing ever goes right
But when your hand is in mine
You got me floatin' on cloud nine

Hey baby are we almost there yet?
And how much cooler could my life get?
Take my hand and take a deep breath
And we'll ride off into the sunset

Look up when the world gets you down
And you're gonna get by
Hang in when the world counts you out
And you're gonna be fine
Sometimes that's life, some days nothing ever goes right
But when your hand is in mine...
Look up when the world gets you down
And you're gonna get by
Hang in when the world counts you out
And you're gonna be fine
Sometimes that's life, some days nothing ever goes right
But if your hand is in mine
I'll be floatin' on cloud nine
For the rest of my life
I'll be floatin' on cloud nine
For the rest of my life

===================


I've had some bummer days
But I ain't lookin' back
I've made a few mistakes
But I'm on the right track

I got somewhere to be
Gotta hurry so I'll make
My date with destiny
'Cause I don't wanna be late
Here we go

I might take my time
'Cause I find the fable had it right
Slow and steady wins the race
And I might lag behind
But I swear I'll cross the finish line
Movin' at a steady pace

I'll give it all I've got
I don't have a lot
But I know a little goes a long way

The truth is hard to face
But I can take a hit
I've lost in many ways
But a winner don't quit

My head is in the game
And the move is mine to make
But I am not afraid
'Cause I'll fight the good fight

I got somewhere to be
Gotta hurry so I'll make
My date with destiny
'Cause I don't wanna be late
Here we go

I might take my time
'Cause I find the fable had it right
Slow and steady wins the race
And I might lag behind
But I swear I'll cross the finish line
Movin' at a steady pace

I'll give it all I've got
I don't have a lot
But I know a little goes a long

I'll give it all I've got
I don't have a lot
But I know a little goes a long way

I got somewhere to be
Gotta hurry so I'll make
My date with destiny
'Cause I don't wanna be late

We bought a tent and some sleeping bags
And we jumped in the truck
North bound on I-35
Before the sun came up

We stopped for lunch in Kanow Park
Passing through the Louvre
Rolled into Bayfield, Wisconsin
And there she was
Madeline Island

We left our cares on the mainland
Boarded a ferry boat
We saw La Pointe for the first time
And we felt right at home

Drove out to Big Bay State Park
Picked out our campsite
We settled in underneath the stars
And there we were

Out there in the great Lake Superior
Right across the bay
We sat back, put our feet up and there we were
Half a world away

Where the waves turned the cliffs into sea caves
With every passing day
It was all a blur, but there we were
On Madeline Island
Madeline Island

We left our shadows on the lake shore
We soaked up all the sights
About drowned in a downpour
But for the northern lights

We shot the breeze under pine trees
And sat around the fire
We hit the hay beneath the Milky Way
And there we were

Out there in the great Lake Superior
Right across the bay
We sat back, put our feet up and there we were
Half a world away

Where the waves turned the cliffs into sea caves
With every passing day
It was all a blur, but there we were
On Madeline Island

Out there in the great Lake Superior
Right across the bay
We sat back, put our feet up and there we were
Half a world away

Where the waves turned the cliffs into sea caves
With every passing day
It was all a blur, but there we were
On Madeline Island
Madeline Island
There we were on Madeline Island

(We made a memory
That will always last
But we went on that trip
Just the three and back)

===================


In a basement of an empty house
I slept on the floor like a vagrant
I braved a Minnesota winter night
And drove to a movie feeling lonely
And as I thawed my heart out by the light
Of the silver screen
I was unaware that you were there In the dark
A silhouette was climbing up the stairs

And what I thought in the parking lot
Was like I just wanna know your name
I drove away with not much to say
But in my hand I held the paper bird
And written on it were the words
"Be brave"

Wildflower knew I wasn't well
But on the kitchen floor I got better again
I grabbed my keys and drove toward a star
And there I was understood for the first time in my life
Cause that's when I was introduced to true serendipity
I knew it when you showed up again
In the snow yeah I was always told
Your heart is where you're home

And what I thought in the coffee shop
Was like the last eight hours was a dream
I drove away with not much to say
But in my hand I held a paper bird
And written on it were the words

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
"OK, I'll be brave"

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
"OK, I'll be brave"

And in my mind
After all this time I think
"Ain't life beautiful and strange?"
I'm blown away
With no words to say
Cause I'll forever be amazed
How I learned the meaning of the phrase
"Be brave"
"Be brave"
"Be brave"
"Be brave"

===================


I'm digging through the glove box
I thought I had a map in here
The driver's door doesn't lock
I bought the car my junior year
There's candy in my backpack
And you can pick our soundtrack
We're heading for the East Coast tonight
So pack your bags and hold on tight
Cuz we're taking off

We're taking off

Run away with me
We're on the way to New York City
Take my hand and see
Manhattan never looked so pretty
Travel light and see the world right
You'll never know if you never go so
Run away with me
And say hello to New York City

Feet up on the dashboard
We're driving with the windows down
Did you forget your phone cord?
We'll buy one in the next small town
Get dinner at an IHOP
A shower at a truck stop
We'll listen to some Johnny Cash
Take my hand and don't look back
Cuz we're movin' on
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
We're movin' on
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)

Run away with me
We're on the way to New York City
Take my hand and see
Manhattan never looked so pretty
Travel light and see the world right
You'll never know if you never go so
Run away with me
And say hello to New York City

Run away
Run away
Run away
Run away

Run away with me
We're on the way to New York City
Take my hand and see
Manhattan never looked so pretty
Travel light and see the world right
You'll never know if you never go so
Run away with me

Stroll the midtown streets
And tell me that you don't feel giddy
Lady Liberty
Ain't throwing us a wink or is she
Travel light and see the world right
You'll never know if you never go so
Run away with me
And say hello to New York City
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Say hello to New York City
(Da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Say hello to New York City

===================


We used to talk all night and not say a word
When I would hop into your red Firebird
And, man alive, we would drive just to drive around town
'Cause in your car we understood and figured out
That everything changes
Everything changes

Tell me why I look back and I wanna cry
Sometimes I feel like we grew up too fast
You and I had the time of our younger lives
Sometimes I sigh and think about the past
But it's alright, cause everything changes

A basement full of boys building homemade bombs
AJ cut his finger and said "go get your mom"
I saw it all through the windshield of my white truck, Troy
Lotsa ups, lotsa downs, lots of growing up
'Cause everything changes
Everything changes

Tell me why I look back and I wanna cry
Sometimes I feel like we grew up too fast
You and I had the time of our younger lives
Sometimes I sigh and think about the past
But it's alright, cause everything changes

Hey Billy, remember when
It was just us (it was just us)
Pretending we were Nash and Coral
On the school bus (on the school bus)
I wouldn't change a thing, 'cause everything changes (changes...)

Life is different now and that's okay with me
I moved away and you started a family
But deep inside you and I are still the same kids
'Cause you're my brother and that won't ever change
Even though everything changes

Tell me why I look back and I wanna cry
Sometimes I feel like we grew up too fast
You and I had the time of our younger lives
Sometimes I sigh and think about the past
But it's alright, yeah it's alright

There's a new guest room in my parents' home
The carpet got replaced a couple years ago
Because it isn't my bedroom anymore
There's new photographs on the freezer door
But it's alright, 'cause everything changes

(Everything changes)
We should talk all night and not say a word
('Cause everything changes)
Let me hop into your red Firebird again

===================

It's been this way from the start
It's like they're always trying to tear us apart
But we will stand strong, stand true
And everybody's gonna watch what we do
And they'll be awestruck saying aw shucks
They either got real good or they got real good luck

And I'd be lying if I said that I could take any more
Cause I've been on my own, trying like never before
And I was lying on the couch and there's this knock on the door
And it's like

All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say, oh...
[x2]

Another day, another chance
We got our card and we're going to the dance
We're gonna stay strong, hold true
And everybody's gonna watch what we do
And they'll be awestruck, saying aw shucks
They either got real good or they got real good luck

And I'd be lying if I said that we could take any more
Cause we're about to light a fire like never before
And if you're lying on the couch and there's a knock on the door
It's like...

All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say, oh...

We'll always be young at heart
And nothing's ever gonna tear us apart
Because we stand strong and stand true
And everybody's gonna watch what we do
And they'll be awestruck saying aw shucks
They either got real good or you know what

All my friends
Woah, come right in
Woah, all my friends
We can take it all back again
Woah, put your hands on in
And lemme hear you say, oh...
[x2]

Lemme hear you say...
We're gonna stay strong, stand true...

===================


A fifteen year old kid from St. Paul
Hopped on a train and headed west
Got a job at a St. Mary Restaurant
Washing dishes and making friends
The years went by like the seasons
And they brought him a lifetime of joy
He bought ten or twelve acres of heaven
And a paradise vantage point
And he built a cabin at the foot of the mountains
That stole his heart when he was a boy

On North Fork Road you're almost home

Get lost in Montana
Where your heart can finally roam
Get lost in Montana
Where the mountains call you home
Get lost forever...

His son worked hard in West Glacier
His daughter sold souvenirs
And he always went back to Polebridge
With his family every year
To his green tin roof in the Rockies
And his sky so full of stars
His spirit lives in these mountains

Get lost in Montana
Where your heart can finally roam
Get lost in Montana
Where the mountains call you home
Get lost forever...

Where adventure calls your name
Every moment is worth more than diamonds
When you spend time in the treasure state
So get lost in the Big Sky country

Get lost in Montana
Where your heart can finally roam
Get lost in Montana
Where the mountains call you home
Get lost forever...

You and I in a little toy shop
Buy a bag of balloons with the money we got
Set them free at the break of dawn
'Til one by one, they were gone
Back at base, bugs in the software
Flash the message, "Something's out there"
Floating in a summer sky
99 red balloons go by

99 dreams I have had
In every one a red balloon
It's all over and I'm standin' pretty
In the dust there was a city
If I could find a souvenir
Just to prove the world was here
Here it is, a red balloon
I think of you and let it go

===================


It gets cold the moment you close your eyes and so terribly dark.
It gets cold the moment I feel your pulse with no blood in your heart.

Dream when you drift of tonight and followed me home.

It gets cold the moment you see the light with no love in your heart.
Ohohoh everynight I can feel you.
Ohohoh when I'm lost and alone
Ohohoh everynight I can feel you.
Ohohoh, everynight.

Lift your voice and sing to the deep sky, hold me close and don't let me go
Spread your tiny wings cuz you're flying high
Ohohoh I swear you make me feel alive

You make me feel alive

It gets real the moment you lose your grip and life tears you apart.
It gets real the moment you see the light with no love in your heart.

Dream when you drift of tonight and followed me home.

Ohohoh everynight I can feel you, 
Ohohoh when I'm lost and alone
Ohohoh everynight I can feel you
Ohohoh everynight

Lift your voice and sing to the deep sky, hold me close and don't let me go, spread your tiny wings cos you're flying high
Ohohoh I swear you make me feel alive.

You make me feel alive

(you make me feel alive)

Ohohoh everynight I can feel you, 
Ohohoh when I'm lost and alone.
Ohohoh everynight I can feel you,
Ohohoh everynight..

Lift your voice and sing to the deep sky, hold me close and don't let me go, spread your tiny wings cos you're flying high

Ohohoh I swear you make me feel alive [x3]

You make me feel alive [x2]

===================


Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead,
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go!

Remember to breathe 'cause it'll take your breath away,
When the engines cough,
And you blast off.
Ignite the night with a firecracker flash.

Remember to live 'cause you're gonna be thrilled to death,
When the stars collide,
And your eyes grow wide.
Take it in with your breath against the glass.

Remember to dream 'cause it's gonna be a starry night
Over every town
As you look down.
So harmonize with the singing satellites.

And remember to scream 'cause you're gonna be lost for words,
When the sparks erupt
And they light you up.
Dip your toes in the galaxy 'cause it's yours to explore tonight.

Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead,
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go!

Roller-coaster through the atmosphere.
I'm drowning in this starry serenade,
Where ecstasy becomes cavalier.
My imagination's taking me away.

Reverie whisper in my ear.
I'm scared to death that I'll never be afraid.
Roller-coaster through the atmosphere.
My imagination's taking me away.

Let's hear it for the Universe
Where it never hurts
Diving in head-first.
Take a taste of the melting Milky Way.

And remember to laugh 'cause you're living in a crazy world
Where you'll never guess
What could happen next.
Give the outer limits my regards as you float to fly away.

Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead,
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go!

Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though I'll never know what's up ahead,
I'm never letting go, I'm never letting go!

In the alligator sky.
In the alligator sky.
In the alligator sky.

===================


When I’m dressed to the nines
I’m just a shirt and tie
With a taste for prestige
And beautiful mystery
But clever girls dressed to kill
Are pretty bittersweet
And better suited for grief 
Than beautiful mystery
Oh beautiful mystery
Fly by feather, this time I’m not ready to die
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Now or never, stand back ‘cause I’m ready to fly
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
She enjoys it the most
With flowers in her hair
Dressing up like a ghost
For beautiful mystery
And so I kiss her goodnight
And stumble from the room 
Mighty high on mystique
And beautiful mystery
Oh beautiful mystery
Fly by feather, this time I’m not ready to die
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Now or never, stand back ‘cause I’m ready to fly
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Fly by feather, this time I’m not ready to die
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Now or never, stand back ‘cause I’m ready to fly
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Fly by feather, this time I’m not ready to die
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you
Now or never, stand back ‘cause I’m ready to fly
But I lose myself
Oh oh, I’m falling for you

===================


Is it a kind of dream,
Floating out on the tide,
Following the river of death downstream?
Oh, is it a dream?

There's a fog along the horizon,
A strange glow in the sky,
And nobody seems to know where you go,
And what does it mean?
Oh, is it a dream?

Bright eyes,
Burning like fire.
Bright eyes,
How can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes.

Is it a kind of shadow,
Reaching into the night,
Wandering over the hills unseen,
Or is it a dream?

There's a high wind in the trees,
A cold sound in the air,
And nobody ever knows when you go,
And where do you start,
Oh, into the dark.

Bright eyes,
burning like fire.
Bright eyes,
how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes.

Bright eyes,
burning like fire.
Bright eyes,
how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes.

===================


I woke up with the sun today
Rolled out of bed and said
"I'm gonna have some fun today"
And that's just what I did

The birds were singing, "Come outside"
I felt giddy like a kid
If life is like a swimming pool
You know I'm jumping in

We've got the perfect summer day
So put me in your plans
You know that
This doesn't happen every day
So everybody, clap your hands

Cause when we
Raise 'em high, every hand in the sky
We're the super fans
Feeling great in the grandstands
Shout it out, make some noise, make it loud
Soaking up the lovely weather
Everything just comes together

I woke up feeling good today
My journey has begun
I gotta give a shout-out to
The green grass and the sun

It's a long way off, a tricky shot
But I know it can be done
Another day, another game
Another hole in one
Yeah!

We've got the perfect summer day
So put me in your plans
You know that
This doesn't happen every day
So everybody, clap your hands

Cause when we
Raise 'em high, every hand in the sky
We're the super fans
Feeling great in the grandstands
Shout it out, make some noise, make it loud
Soaking up the lovely weather
Everything just comes together

Lift 'em up, all our hands, all at once
We're the super fans
Feeling great in the grandstands
Keep 'em there, all our hands, in the air
We're wishing it could last forever
Baby, put your hands together

The weather's just so fine
Wish I could bottle time
'Cause if you only pause
You'll hear the crowd applaud
They're cheering for you now
Stand up and take a bow
You know that you deserve it
Today is picture perfect

Raise 'em high, every hand in the sky
We're the super fans
Feeling great in the grandstands
Shout it out, make some noise, make it loud
Soaking up the lovely weather
Everything just comes together

Clap our hands! Clap our hands! Clap our hands!
We're the super fans
Feeling great in the grandstands
Clap our hands! Clap our hands! Clap our hands!
We're wishing it could last forever
Baby, put your hands together

That's why we clap our hands
That's why we clap our hands

===================


Come thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
Mount of thy redeeming love

Here I raise my Ebenezer
Hither by thy help I come
And I hope by thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home

Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wondering from the fold of God
He, to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let thy goodness like a fetter,
Bind my wandering heart to thee

Cause prone to wander Lord I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, o take and seal it,
Seal it for thy courts above

Unto you, I pledge my love

===================


There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered "have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Oh, Taylor, I was so enchanted to meet you too

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too

The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wondered till I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
Hey, it was enchanting to meet you
Oh, Taylor, I was so enchanted to meet you too

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too

And this is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you too
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew...

This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
Taylor, I'll spend my whole life wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too

I was never in love with someone else
I never had somebody waiting on me
'Cause you were all of my dreams come true
And I just wish you knew
Taylor, I was so in love with you

===================


I went to a garden party to reminisce with my old friends
A chance to share old memories and play our songs again
When I got to the garden party, they all knew my name
But no one recognized me, I didn’t look the same

But it’s all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself

People came from miles around and everyone was there
Yoko brought her walrus, there was magic in the air
And over in the corner, much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan’s shoes, wearing his disguise

But it’s all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself

I played them all the old songs, I thought that’s why they came
But no one heard the music, we didn’t look the same
I said hello to Mary Lou, she belongs to me
And when I sang a song about a Honky Tonk, it was time to leave

But it’s all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself

Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped Johnny B. Good
Playing guitar like ringing a bell and looking like he should
If you gotta play at garden parties, I wish you a lot of luck
But if memories were all I sang, I’d rather drive a truck

But it’s all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself
You see, you can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself

You can’t please everyone so you gotta please yourself

===================


I was a hot mess
In my Sunday best
Black tears in my eyes
You were my first love
You were my only one
I can't believe your lies

Once we were like bottle rockets
Now I know I have to stop it

Please believe me
This isn't easy
I just need to say goodbye

Goodbye [2x]
Losin' my mind
Goodbye

You got a new friend
You like to play pretend
I'm just keepin' my cool
Turn on the smoke machine
Magic and make believe
She'll never know you like I do

Once we were a fire burnin'
Now you're just a lesson I'm learning

Please believe me
This isn't easy
I just need to say goodbye

Goodbye [2x]
Losin' my mind
Goodbye

I know that I can find somebody
You won't ever find nobody else like me
[4x]

Once we were like bottle rockets
Now I know I have to stop it

Please believe me
This isn't easy
I just need to say goodbye

Goodbye [2x]
Losin' my mind
Goodbye

I gotta say goodbye
This isn't easy 
I gotta say goodbye

===================


Everywhere, everybody needs a neighbor
Showing up when times get hard
But there's friends of sons and daughters
Saying grace without supper in your backyard
Who doesn't wanna be a hero?
At least a little bit of helping out
There's something you're never gonna help or change
But hunger's something we can turn around
Here's hope (Here's hope)
Showing up at your front door
Here's hope (Here's hope)
Yeah what's everybody looking for
Here's your one chance to make a difference
Here's your one choice to give a helping hand
There's room at the table for more
Yeah here's hope.. Yeah here's hope
There's a small town girl in third grade
Making sure her sisters get enough
She sees her mama working two jobs
Worrying and crying, doing everything but giving up
If a miracle's a gift when you need it
Then it's time for stepping in
Here's to families and kids
Wherever you live
Never ever wondering again

Here's hope (Here's hope)
Showing up at your front door
Here's hope (Here's hope)
Yeah what's everybody looking for
Here's your one chance to make a difference
Here's your one choice to give a helping hand
There's room at the table for more
Yeah here's hope
Here's to going to bed not hungry
Here's to changing the story
Here's to bigger heart and brighter days
Let me hear you sing it for me
Let me hear you sing it for me
Here's hope (Here's hope)
Showing up at your front door
Here's hope (Here's hope)
Yeah what's everybody looking for
Here's your one chance to make a difference
Here's your one choice to give a helping hand
There's room at the table for more
Yeah here's hope (Here's hope)
Yeah here's hope (Here's hope)

Hey Anna, he’s just a boy you won’t understand if you try
So, hey Anna, smile when he’s holding your hand tonight
Hey Anna, remember when you’re wishing away your life

Makes your heart race

Love is a blind date
And it’s making your heart pound

Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh

Hey Anna, he’s just a boy you won’t understand if you try
So, hey Anna, smile when he’s holding your hand tonight
Hey Anna, remember when you’re wishing away your life
Hey, hey Anna, everything is going to turn out just fine

Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh

Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-whoa-oh

===================


Just around the corner there’s heartaches
Down the street that losers use
If you can wade in through the teardrops
You’ll find me at the home of the blues
I walk and cry while my heart beat
Keeps time with the drag of my shoes
The sun don’t shine through this window of mine
‘Cause it’s dark at the home of the blues

Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest memories
Memories so sweet that I cry
And dreams that I’ve had left me feeling so bad
I just wanna give up and lay down and die

So if you just lost your sweetheart
And it seems that there’s no good way to choose
Well come along with me, misery loves company
And you’re welcome at the home of the blues
‘Cause just around the corner there’s heartaches
Down the street that losers use
If you can wade in through the teardrops
You’ll find me at the home of the blues
You’ll find me at the home of the blues
You’re gonna find me at the home of the blues

===================


That moment the first few flakes start falling
Is the moment before I burst into tears
'Cause snow in the air means Christmas shopping
And the thought of it all just stresses me out
Wo-oh-oe is me
Wo-oh-oe is me

Would she kinda like this canary yellow?
Or does she already own way too many scarves?
I could get her a backpack and something to carry
This is way too much pressure, it's breaking my heart
Wo-oh-oe is me
Wo-oh-oe is me

I'm ready to wrap that perfect Christmas gift
But I haven't found it yet
'Cause I don't have a clue what to get you
So I'll give you my heart
I wander around the store again and again
But all I do is shrug
'Cause I don't have a clue what to get you
And I'm ready to say, "Bah humbug"!
(Bah bah bah bah [x4])
Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah humbug
(Bah bah bah bah [x4])
Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah

I could get her a gift card to Olive Garden
But what if Red Lobster is way more her thing?
I don't even know
Well how 'bout a bike, or like a ukelele?
Or how 'bout I jump out the window? (window [x4])
Yeah, how 'bout I jump out the window? (window [x4])
Singing 'Joy to the World' face down in the snow!

I'm ready to wrap that perfect Christmas gift
But I haven't found it yet
'Cause I don't have a clue what to get you
So I'll give you my heart, I hope it'll do
I wander around the store again and again
But all I do is shrug
'Cause I don't have a clue what to get you
And I'm ready to say

I'll wrap myself in paper and sit under the tree
'Cause the best gift I can give you is this heart inside of me!

I'm ready to wrap that perfect Christmas gift
But I ain't found it yet!
'Cause I don't have a clue what to get you (here's my heart)
So I'll give you my heart, I hope it'll do
I wander around the store again and again
But all I do is shrug
'Cause I don't have a clue what to get you
And I'm 'bout ready to say, "Bah humbug!"

(Bah bah bah bah [x4])
Sorry for the hand towels!
Bah humbug!
(Bah bah bah bah [x4])
Sorry for the Yankee candles!
Bah humbug!
(Bah bah bah bah [x2])
Sorry for all this useless junk!
The best gift I have to give
Is my love

(Huh. I hate shopping)

===================


She wound a thread around the pieces of my broken heart
And left me to believe
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna leave

A starry night without a fear of heights
I can't recall, 'cause I learned after all
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna fall

As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn
As your sweet dreams take flight, I'll crash and burn
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me

Da da da da da da daaaaa
Da da da da da da daaaaa (girls, girls don't wanna leave)

I miss the way she whispered in my ear
Before she left, had me so convinced
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna leave

And Juliet's romantic balcony
Wears out the wall, but I learned after all
That girls don't wanna, girls don't wanna fall

As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn
As your sweet dreams take flight, I'll crash and burn
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me

When you're alone
I hope my ghost never leaves
'Cause when I'm home
Your painful memory is always haunting me

As you doze off tonight, I'll toss and turn
As your sweet dreams take flight, I'll crash and burn
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe
As you stir in your sleep, the thought is killing me

When I see you around, my eyes go wide
When you race through my mind, I die inside
While your heart flutters free, I still can't breathe
As you stir in your sleep, I hope you think of me

Da da da da da da daaaaa
I hope you think of me
Da da da da da da daaaaa
I hope you think of me
Da da da da da da daaaaa
I hope you think of me
Da da da da da da daaaaa

===================


There’s more that rises in the morning than the sun
And more that shines in the night than just the moon
It’s more than this fire here that keeps me warm
In a shelter that is larger than this room

And there’s a loyalty that’s deeper than mere sentiments
And a music higher than the songs that I can sing
The stuff of earth competes with allegiance
I owe only to the Giver of all good things

So if I stand let me stand on the promise
That You will pull me through
And if I can’t let me fall on the grace
That first brought me to You

And if I sing let me sing for the joy
That has born in me these songs
And if I weep let it be
As a man who is longing for his home
Oh, yeah

There’s more that dances on the prairies than the wind
And more that pulses in the ocean than the tide
There’s a love that’s fiercer than the love between friends
More gentle than a mother’s when her baby’s at her side

And there’s a loyalty that’s deeper than mere sentiments
And a music higher than the songs that I can sing
The stuff of earth competes with allegiance
I owe only to the Giver of all good things

So if I stand let me stand on the promise
That You will pull me through
And if I can’t let me fall on the grace
That first brought me to You

And if I sing let me sing for the joy
That has born in me these songs
And if I weep let it be
As a man who is longing for his home
Oh

So if I stand let me stand on the promise
That You will pull me through
And if I can’t let me fall on the grace
That first brought me to You

And if I sing let me sing for the joy
That has born in me these songs
And if I weep let it be
As a man who is longing for his home

And if I weep let it be
As a man who is longing for his home

===================

Just an outline made of skin
And my walls are paper thin
I want to let you color me in

Feel like I’m drowning from the sound
Of all the silence all around
My thoughts are gone
I’m going down
I’m turning inside out

This time I finally need a light, a light
Tired of seeing in black and white, white

Having flashes in my mind
Can’t take the ticking of time
The time that’s passing by...

[repeat x2]

===================


Shave it up
Shave

===================


Breathing you in when I want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quiet drama

Wearing your heart like a stolen dream
Opening skies with your broken keys
No one can blind us any longer

We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go

We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go

Breathing you in when I want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quiet drama

[Long back-beat]

Breathing you in when I want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quiet drama

Wearing your heart like a stolen dream
Opening skies with your broken keys
No one can blind us any longer

We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go

We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go

We'll run where lights won't chase us
Hide where love can save us
I will never let you go

[Long back-beat]

Breathing you in when I want you out
Finding our truth in a hope of doubt
Lying inside our quiet drama

===================


I was a boat drifting out into sea
I had nothing but pieces of thoughts of the hope that you would see me
I was a stone’s throw away from land
But thousands and thousands of miles away from reaching your hand

The waves that crashed upon
The rocks that you were trying to walk along
And in my head I heard them play a song
For you and me

The waves that crashed upon
The rocks that you were trying to step along
And in my head I heard them play a song
For you and me

Let’s get lost at Sea
Where they will never find us
Got stars at night to guide us
Lost at Sea
Where they will never find us
Got stars at night to guide us

Oh yeah

[repeat]

===================


High dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash 'cause we both know how this ends
A clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass and I drown in you again

'Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why

If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

(Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey)

If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

Walk on through a red parade and refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground and makes us forget all common sense
Don't speak as I try to leave 'cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull then I'll push too deep and I'll fall right back to you

'Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why

If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

(Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey)

Why are you my clarity?
Why are you my remedy?
Why are you my clarity?
Why are you my remedy?

If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

===================


This feeling is heavy
Makes my body ache and I’m ready
To fall into the sky
I see now
The reason why

My heart is heavy
Takes me to a place I can’t breathe
Only then I know why I see
The warning sign

===================


Fading, so slow, black hole
I feel it slipping away
We’re all we’ve got
If you’re lost I’m diving in after you
I would touch the sun I’d come undone
It’s true, I’d fall for you

Wherever you go, whatever you do
You know I’ll follow you down
Wherever you go, if ever you lose your ground
I’ll follow you down
I’ll follow you
Down...

You’re lost, worn out, face down
Don’t know where you’re headed to
Right here, right now, somehow I
I’ll light the way up for you
I would touch the sun I’d come undone
It’s true, I’d fall for you

===================


[Hayley Williams]
I know that we are upside down
So hold your tongue and hear me out
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

You kill the lights, I'll draw the blinds
Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Oh oh oh, are you gonna stay the night?

Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So oh oh oh, are you gonna stay the night?

[Beat break]

Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So oh oh, are you gonna stay the night?

I am a fire, you're gasoline,
Come pour yourself all over me
We'll let this place go down in flames only one more time

You kill the lights, I'll draw the blinds
Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Oh oh oh, are you gonna stay the night?

Are you gonna stay the night? (we get burned!)
Doesn't mean we're bound for life (we never learn!)
So oh oh, are you gonna stay the night?
Night night night night night...

[Beat break]

ARE YOU GONNA STAY THE NIGHT?!

[Beat break]

Are you gonna stay the night?
Doesn't mean we're bound for life
So oh oh, are you gonna stay the night?

[Zedd:]
Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Oh oh oh oh.
Are you gonna stay the night?

===================


With my words, across your face, 
you're making up stories of your own. 
Little bits of white paper, 
in pockets deeper than you know. 

You painted black upon the whitest lies 
you've seen them fall, you have seen them rise, 
you painted black upon the whitest lies, lies, your lies. 

Push play, stop rewind 
you drown your heroes in red wine. 
Push play, stop rewind, 
you drown your heroes in red wine. 
Push play, stop rewind 
you drown your heroes in red wine. 
Push play, stop rewind. 
You painted black upon the whitest lies 
you've seen them fall, you have seen them rise, 
you painted black upon the whitest lies, lies, your lies. 

Push play, stop rewind 
you drown your heroes in red wine. 
Push play, stop rewind, 
you drown your heroes in red wine. 

Close enough to see your hands - sneaking out of these,(his) embrace 
Paper thin, whispering, breaking in 
You painted black upon the whitest lies 
you've seen them fall, you have seen them rise, 
you painted black upon the whitest lies, lies, your lies. 

Push play, stop rewind 
you drown your heroes in red wine. 
Push play, stop rewind, 
you drown your heroes in red wine. 

Push play, stop rewind 
you drown your heroes in red wine. 
Push play, stop rewind, 
you drown your heroes in red wine.

Days go by my window
World slows down as it goes
Goodbye to last night
Lost love out of sight
Can’t you help me see?
(They won’t get right)

Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive
Alive Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive
Alive, alive, alive
 
Waking in the snow
Tracing steps with you
Swimming through the smoke
Wrapped in velvet coat
Can’t you help me see?
(They won’t get right)
 
Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive,
alive Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive, alive
Alive, alive, alive
 
Can you describe through me
All the world that you see?
I need someone, I’m just waiting on
Freedom is within you
Giving makes us feel good
Hello to our people
Say hello to the future
Freedom is within you
Giving makes us feel good
Hello to our ṗeople
Say hello to the future
 
Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive,
alive Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive, alive
Alive, alive, alive
Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive
Alive Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive
Alive, alive, alive

===================


We are, we are violent chemistry
Love has taken us as far as we can reach
But I can't leave
We are, we are, imagine ecstasy
Holding on to what we used to be
Addicted to a memory
Holding on to what we used to be
Addicted to a memory
Oh, memory

We are, we are in-love enemies
We are sentimental slaves on broken knees
We're on empty
We were, we were one identity
Now the trouble is remembering
Addicted to a memory

===================


[Partial Chorus:]
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course

[Verse 1:]
I'm slippin' down a chain reaction
And here I go, here I go, here I go, go
And once again, I'm yours in fractions
It takes me down, pulls me down, pulls me down low

[Pre-Chorus:]
Honey, it's rainin' tonight
But storms always have an eye, have an eye
Tell me your cover tonight
Or tell me lies, tell me lies, lies, lies...

[Chorus:]
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me, we're the same force
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light
I want you to know that I'm all yours
You and me run the same course

[Post-Chorus:]
I want you to know that it's our time
You and me bleed the same light

[Verse 2:]
I'm better under your reflection
But did you know, did you know, did you know, know
That's anybody else that's met ya
It's all the same, all the same, all the same glow

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Drop:]
You and me run the same course

===================


I see what you're wearing, there's nothing beneath it
Forgive me for staring, forgive me for breathing
We might not know why, we might not know how
But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now

We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now

We might not know why, we might not know how
But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now
We'll light up the sky, we'll open the clouds
Cause baby, tonight, we're beautiful now, we're beautiful

[Beats break]

We're beautiful

Wherever it's going, I'm gonna chase it
What's left of this moment, I'm not gonna waste it
Stranded together, our worlds have collided
This won't be forever, so why try to fight it?

We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now

We might not know why, we might not know how
But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now
We'll light up the sky, we'll open the clouds
Cause baby, tonight, we're beautiful now, we're beautiful

[Beats break]

We're beautiful

Let's live tonight like fireflies
And one by one light up the sky
We disappear and pass the crown
You're beautiful, you're beautiful

We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now (beautiful)
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful

We're beautiful
We're beautiful now

We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful

===================


[X Ambassadors:]
We're smart enough to know that no one gets out alive (never, ever)
Hold on to someone close, friend
Cause you're never too young, you're never too young, never too young to die
Remember the ghosts before you, and drink to the souls tonight
And don't forget what they told you
You're never too young, you're never too young, never too young to die

You're never too young
You're never too, never too
No, you're never too young
Never, never

[Logic:]
Uh, tell me is it the day I made it?
Feel like the world is over, don't know why I've been created
I've been under pressure but nevertheless I know nothing can measure
Feeling outdated, everybody inebriated
Feel like I'm automated, I'm automated, I'm automated
No, never faded, but debated a visionary that made it
As it escalated, I elevated and feel like I read it again
Cause all of this, it just sounded the same in my mind

[X Ambassadors:]
We're smart enough to know that no one gets out alive (never, ever)
Hold on to someone close, friend
Cause you're never too young, you're never too young, never too young to die
Remember the ghosts before you, and drink to the souls tonight
And don't forget what they told you
You're never too young, you're never too young, never too young to die

You're never too young
You're never too, never too
No, you're never too young
Never, never

We're smart enough to know that no one gets out alive (never, ever)
Hold on to someone close, friend
Cause you're never too young, you're never too young, never too young to die
Remember the ghosts before you, and drink to the souls tonight
And don't forget what they told you
You're never too young, you're never too young, never too young to die

===================


Baby, if you're done with love, who's gonna hold you tonight?
Are you done with love so they can't hurt you tomorrow?
You don't wanna keep on swimming in the ocean you've cried
But I won't let you drown, I'll pull you back to the shallow

Cause all I ever really wanted
In this short life was you
Tell me who took your heart away
And do you know it breaks mine when I hear you say
That you're done with love?
Oh, you are done with love

[Chorus x2:]
Give me one night to mend the pain
Because the second we touch, you'll forget the day
You were done with love
Oh, you were done with love

All I ever really wanted
In this short life was you
All I ever really wanted
In this short life was you

[Chorus]

If you're done with love

[Chorus]

You think you're done with love
You think you're done with love
You think you're done with love
You think you're done with love

===================


Stars fall at my feet,
Keep me grounded as I reach
Higher than I see.
Is there something there for me?
Pulling back the reins,
Letting go again
I'm not afraid. I'm not.

[Chorus:]
All my life,
One page at a time
I'll show you my-my true colours
No, I won't apologize
For the fire in my eyes
Let me show you my-my true colours.
It ain't no rainbow

A promise with a lie
Is broken by design
What we thought we knew
Has been swallowed by the truth
It's time to light the flame
Right before it rains
I'm not afraid. I'm not.

[Chorus]

Something tells me I know nothing at all
We've escaped our capture yet we have our masters
And somehow it's like I've waited

[Chorus]

===================


Take your dark days and send them to the sun and carry on, carry on
To every lover who ever did you wrong, move along, move along
To every dream that drowned this dream and made you small inside
Take your dark days and send them to the sun and carry on

[Chorus:]
Let it go 'til you let go of all the anger
And all the words that made you hurt will burn like paper
Straight into the fire, straight into the fire
And let it go until the smoke is gone forever

Crack the windows and take the shutters down and carry on, carry on
Take just one seed and put it in the ground and move along, move along
Cause it's easy to hold on, but so hard to forgive
So take the dark days and send them to the sun and carry on

[Chorus]

I will not rest until I see
The other side
I will not rest until I learn
To say goodbye

===================


Now we're staring at the ceiling
You're so pretty when you're mad
All that I can hear is breathing
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, aah-aah-aah-aah-aah
And we're stuck inside the silence
In a cold cold war
We're too proud to say we're sorry
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, aah-aah-aah-aah-aah

Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words will tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a papercut
Right now I don't know why I love you
But by the morning when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a papercut

I find refuge in a distance
Even when we're breaking down (down, down, down, down)
Can't we pause it just for one kiss
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, aah-aah-aah-aah-aah
Cause I never meant to hurt you
And I know you feel the same
Still the only one I run to
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, aah-aah-aah-aah-aah

Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words will tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a papercut
Right now I don't know why I love you
But by the morning when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a papercut

Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words will tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a papercut
Right now I don't know why I love you
But by the morning when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a papercut

Just a paper, just a papercut
Just a paper, just a papercut
Just a paper, just a papercut
Just a paper, just a papercut

===================


Break through
Break through
Break through
It's alright to break through

Break through
Break through
Break through
It's alright to break through

===================


Daisy, always climbing up the same tree
Finding love in all the wrong scenes, Daisy, you got me
Daisy, always walking down the wrong streets
Starting fires out of dead weeds, Daisy, you got me

[Chorus:]
Let me show you how a kiss should taste
Trust me, I won't give your heart away
Why you running, running when you got it right here?
Oh, I would love you if you let me

Daisy, always dancing to the same beat
Broken records stuck on repeat, Daisy, you got me
Daisy, don't you know that you're amazing?
Broken hearts just keeps on breaking, Daisy
I would take the light out the stars to help you see
Anything to guide you straight to me

[Chorus x2]

I won't give your heart away
Why you running, running when you got it right here?

===================


It feels like the fairytale is over, I really wanted these pages to begin
With "Once upon a time" like all those lullabies
I should've known better, I'll admit it, I thought when I let you in
You were my shining knight from all those stories

This love is your illusion, this love is your illusion
Take me to a place with real-life love
I need a break from this broken-down fantasy
Show me a place I can realize love, not your illusion

It feels like the fairytale is over, I really wanted these pages to begin

This love is your illusion, this love is your illusion
Take me to a place with real-life love

Waking up next to you in the middle of the week
Never needed anyone to send me off to sleep
And I know I said go slow, but I can't hold back no more
Got a premonition this ain't gonna be a fling

You make a weekend feel like a year
Baby, you got me changing
24/7, I want you here
I hope you feel the same thing

I want you to be the one that's on my mind, on my mind, on my mind
I want you to be there on a Monday night, Tuesday night, every night
Are you gonna be the one that's on my mind? 365, all the time
I want you to be the one to stay
You give me the night and day

Love it when you come back and can't take it when you leave
Got me fantasizing our initials already
And I wanna just let go, falling deeper than before
Say that you are ready, lock it up in a heartbeat

I want you to be the one that's on my mind, on my mind, on my mind
I want you to be there on a Monday night, Tuesday night, every night
Are you gonna be the one that's on my mind? 365, all the time
I want you to be the one to stay
You give me the night and day

I think about you all the time
24/7, 365
I think about you all the time
24/7, 365

Ooh...
Are you gonna be the one?
Ooh...
Are you gonna be the one? (Are you gonna be the one?)
I want you to be the one

I want you to be the one that's on my mind, on my mind, on my mind
I want you to be there on a Monday night, Tuesday night, every night
Are you gonna be the one that's on my mind? 365, all the time
I want you to be the one to stay
You give me the night and day

I think about you all the time
24/7, 365
I think about you all the time
24/7, 365

Living for tomorrow
Lost within a dream
Tryna find the answer to the question
And it seems that love makes the world feel good

Singing in the moonlight
Dancing in the rain
Let the sunshine through to lift your spirit once again
Cause love makes the world feel good

Chasing after rainbows
Somewhere in the sky

And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good

Riding on the river
Of hearts that beat as one
This feels like forever and we've only just begun
Cause love makes the world feel good

Holding on the memories
Cause smiles are still alive
Looking to the future and there's happiness in sight
Cause love makes the world feel good

Walking through my past life
Where the days are full of joy

And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good

The Candyman can cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good

===================


Silent love is calling faith
To shatter me through your hallways
Into echoes you can feel
And rehearse the way you heal

Make them dance
Just like you
'Cause you make me move
Yeah you always make me go

I'll run away with your foot steps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself
I will find you

High on words
We almost used
We're fireworks with a wet fuse
Flying planes with paper wheels
To the same Achilles heels

Make them dance
Just like you
'Cause you make me move
Yeah you always make me go

I'll run away with your foot steps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself
I will find you

Yeah you always make me go

Open up your skies
Turn up your night
To the speed of life
Turn up your night
Put your love in lights
Turn up your night
I will find you

Make them dance
Just like you
'Cause you make me move
Yeah you always make me go

Yeah you always make me go

I'll run away with your foot steps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself
I will find you

Yeah you always make me go go go go go
Turn up your night
Go go go go
Turn up your night
Go go go go turn it up turn it up
Turn up your night
I will find you

Make them dance
Just like you
'Cause you make me move
Yeah you always make me go

===================


Chained to a love
But that don't mean much
Sensitive tough, you don't get enough
I've been drowning in your, lost in the rush
Faded, you stuck? I'll help you up

I don't care if we get too loud
Sexy, I want you now
Bet I could take you there
Whispering in your ear
What do you wanna feel?
Let's just enjoy the thrill
I'll take over the wheel
And give you the touch you're missing

Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb

Beautiful as you are, I wanna light up your dark
Maybe you don't believe in me
It's hard to know what you see in me
Don't be quick to say no
My chest is your pillow
Come out of the shadows, I know that you're fragile, yeah

I don't care if we get too loud
Sexy, I want you now
Bet I could take you there
Whispering in your ear
What do you wanna feel?
Let's just enjoy the thrill
I'll take over the wheel
And give you the touch you're missing

Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb

I like the way you take me there
I like the way you touch yourself
Don't hold back, I want that
When the water come down, I'mma get in that
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb

I'm right here, you know, when your waves explode
Escape the undertow
Know that you've been broken
Know that you've been hoping
Swimming in your ocean
A new life is floating
The stars were made to shine
Reach up and make a wish
It's a beautiful time, I hope you take a glimpse
We're the sound of lovers blowing crazy in the wind
You don't have to pretend
I don't care where you've been

Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb

I like the way you take me there
I like the way you touch yourself
Don't hold back, I want that
When the water come down, I'mma get in that
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, let's go
Get low, get low
Girl, you got the vibe, I'm up for the climb

===================


I booked myself tables at all the best restaurants then eat alone
I buy myself fast cars just so I can drive them real fucking slow
I like my own company, company I don't need it
I'm not always cold, I'm just good on my own, so good on my own

I've always been told, one day I'll find
Somebody who changes my mind
If they come along, I won't think twice

'Cause I already got a good thing with me
Yeah, I already got everything I need
The best things in life are already mine
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I already got a good thing with me
Yeah, I've already done everything I've dreamed
I'm good by myself, don't need no one else
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I've already got a good thing

I make myself up just to dance in the mirror when I'm at home
I pose and take pictures then send them to people that I don't know
I like getting compliments, compliments how I'm feeling, ooh
I'm not always selfish, just bad at romance, it's not in my bones

I've always been told, one day I'll find
Somebody who changes my mind
If they come along, I won't think twice

'Cause I already got a good thing with me
Yeah, I already got everything I need
The best things in life are already mine
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I already got a good thing with me
Yeah, I've already done everything I've dreamed
I'm good by myself, don't need no one else
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I've already got a good thing

I've always been told, one day I'll find
Somebody who changes my mind
If they come along, I won't think twice

'Cause I already got a good thing with me
Yeah, I already got everything I need
The best things in life are already mine
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I already got a good thing with me
Yeah, I've already done everything I've dreamed
I'm good by myself, don't need no one else
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I've already got a good thing

===================


You're a world away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now?
There's nothing left to say
So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me, babe
Are you happy now?

You're the only one who can up and run
Leave me just as empty as the day you came
And you hold all the cards, all the broken hearts
Strung over your shoulder till it's all in vain

And only you know the strength of your teeth
The wash in the weight of your pockets, so deep
And lonely

You're a world away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now?
There's nothing left to say
So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me, babe
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

(You're the only one who can)

In the palm of your hands
You can make me dance
Spin me around in circles till I'm wrapped in string
You keep on talking sweet till your fingers bleed
But don't you dare ask me how I've been

Now only you know the strength of your teeth
The wash in the weight of your pockets, so deep
And lonely

You're a world away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now?
There's nothing left to say
So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me, babe
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

(You're the only one who can
You're the only, you're the only
You're the only one who can
You're the only, you're the only)

World away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now?
There's nothing left to say
So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me, babe
Are you happy now?

There's a fire that burns inside
It's an instinct that never lies
The target's tattooed between our eyes

Stand and fight
Under the lights on the high stage
A part of your life it can take away
Just like the blood running through your veins

Everyone's watching through your eyes
There's only two options
Win or die, win or die
Win or die, die, die, die, die
It went from a spark to an open flame
Now destiny's calling out your name
So reply, so reply

And ignite
Ignite
Ignite
Ignite

There's a power that's underneath
And you can't see it 'til you believe
On the edge of infinity

Feel the rush
Under the lights on the high stage
A part of your life it can take away
Just like the blood running through your veins

Everyone's watching through your eyes
There's only two options
Win or die, win or die
Win or die, die, die, die, die
It went from a spark to an open flame
Now destiny's calling out your name
So reply, so reply

And ignite
Ignite
Ignite
Ignite

It went from a spark to an open flame
Now destiny's calling out your name
So ignite, so ignite

Don't slam the fucking door
Shit!

Don't slam the fucking door
Shit!

Listen, I'm going to give you a clue here now
I don't want any more bullshit anytime during the day, from anyone,
that includes me
It's going to be very hot, going to be very uncomfortable for everybody
Don't anybody yelling?
We get anybody yelling around here anymore today and then the shit is going to hit the fan
Why are... I just... lose stuff! Why can't I remember it?
Don't slam the fucking door
Don't slam the fucking door
Shit!

===================


You light me up
You bring the crowd
I think about this
Every time the stars come out

You light me up
You chase the clouds
I think about this
Every time the stars come out

Every time the stars come out
Every time the stars come out
Every time the stars come out
Every time the stars come out

Every time the stars come

You light me up
You bring the crowd

Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to

Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

All you have to do is... uh
All you have to do is stay

Won't admit what I already know
I've never been the best at letting go
I don't wanna spend the night alone
Guess I need you, and I need to

Make it on my own, but I don't wanna grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a million reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

All you have to do is... uh
All you have to do is stay

All you have to do is stay
So stay
Yeah

All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is stay
Stay

===================


Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess
Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
I can't just let you go

Oh baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle

Take a step
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still running, dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess
Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
I can't just let you go

Oh baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle

Looking at you I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless my objection
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin just
Come over, pull me in just

Oh baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle, no no

Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle, oh yeah
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, oh
In the middle
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle, baby
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, middle
In the middle, middle

===================

This is the moment
Where it begins
You pull me closer
Under my skin

I don't wanna have fate

This is temptation
And this is the sin
It's growing inside me
I can't keep, I can't keep it in

So break me open
Like a room you walk in
And take me over
Around you and with me

I can't keep
I can't keep
Around you
I can't keep
Around you and with me

This is temptation
And this is the sin
Its growing inside me
I can't keep, I can't keep it in

So break me open
Like a room you walk in
And take me over
Around you and with me

===================


Darling, you see now
That it never was
We are never what we see
Set you up to
Let you down, I'm afraid

Darling, do you see how
Our lies become the truth
We never said what we mean
Built you up to
Break you down, I'm afraid
I'm afraid

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom running
To the ones we love
To the ones we hurt

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom feeding
On the ones we love
On the ones we hurt

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom running
To the ones we love

Darling, it feels good
When they let you in
Don't you play the fool
They will only
Let you down if you stay
We can't all be broken down, I'm afraid
I'm afraid

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom running
To the ones we love
To the ones we hurt

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom feeding
On the ones we love
On the ones we hurt

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom running
To the ones we love (to the ones we love)
To the ones we hurt

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom feeding
On the ones we love
On the ones we hurt

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom running
To the ones we love (to the ones we love)
To the ones we hurt

Holy hell
We've hit the bottom feeding
On the ones we love
On the ones we hurt

===================


The world's in constant motion
And so are all of us.
You love the glow of sunrise,
My stars come out at night.

Your quiet pierces through me,
There's freedom renewed.
It takes me to a place where
The solace drops right through.

As you cut your ties with burden
The ground gets further away.
Now that we are weightless
I just have to say...

===================


Only you took me there
To the place where I live still
No one else could see me whole
But this thing you've built with care has been sold
Me for you
I was well
Now I'm weak but I need to break this spell
Time is not on my side
It stands still, it lingers, it just hides
Oh I'm dying and I'm done
Nothing here
I am done
Sometimes I wish I never met you
Sometimes I wish I never met you
Sometimes I wish I never met you 
Out of my heart still
Out of my mind still
I wanna have some peace
Out of my heart still
Out of my mind still
I wanna have some peace
Out of my heart still
Out of my mind still
I wanna have some peace
Out of my heart still
Out of my mind still
I wanna have some peace
Sometimes I wish I never met you
Sometimes I wish I never met you
Out of my heart still
Out of my mind still
I wanna have some peace (sometimes I wish I never met you)
Out of my heart still
Out of my mind still
I wanna have some peace (sometimes I wish I never met you)
Out of my heart still
Out of my mind still
I wanna have some peace (sometimes I wish I never met you)
Out of my heart still
Out of my mind still
I wanna have some peace
Out of my heart still
Out of my mind still
I wanna have some peace
Out of my heart still
Out of my mind still
I wanna have some peace
Out of my heart still
Out of my mind still
I wanna have some peace
Out of my heart still
Out of my mind still
I wanna have some peace
Out of my heart still
Out of my mind still
I wanna have some peace
Out of my heart still
Out of my mind still
I wanna have some peace

Ad I found something new
And I just can’t walk away
I just can’t walk away
There’s something close to me
Just the way that it has to be
The way that it has to be
It’s like a brand new start
But I’m feeling like it’s falling apart
I’m feeling like it’s falling apart
There’s no one to blame
I’m writing out this song in the rain
I didn’t want to give it a name [x2]
I found something new
I just can’t walk away [x6]
I found something new
And I just can’t walk away
I just can’t walk away
There’s something close to me
Just the way that it has to be
The way that it has to be
It’s like a brand new start
But I’m feeling like it’s falling apart
I’m feeling like it’s falling apart
There’s no one to blame
I’m writing out this song in the rain
I didn’t want to give it a name [x2]
I found something new
And I just can’t walk away
I just can’t walk away
There’s something close to me
Just the way that it has to be
The way that it has to be

===================


I used to talk about waking up
Like somehow you'd still be here, only better
The story is ending everafter
We have learned to see each other
To laugh when we could cry
Just cry

I didn't know there was a different kind of life
[x2]

You are the hardest choice I have to make (you are the one)
Sometimes I wish that I was stronger
Is it or what is it, can I do it?
Will you be here when it's over?
Don't know, but I will try
Just try

I didn't know there was a different kind of life
[x2]

===================


We used to be so certain
We used to know it again
But now we run in circles
And we get lost along the way
And nights forever falling
And tangled in the haze
But in the light of dawn
We watch it burn away
So long as I can breathe
It's you who shakes me
So long as I can breathe
You're still the one who wakes me
So long as I can breathe
It's you who shakes me
So long as I can breathe
You're still the one who wakes me
So if we're tired of trying
And we'll forget the days
When nothing came before us
And know when things could change
Cause when there's smoke, there's fire
Im hearing in the grave
There's still a spark in us
Hold on to yesterday
So long as I can breathe
It's you who shakes me
So long as I can breathe
You're still the one who wakes me

===================


You
You made my heart move
Don't ask me how it felt they won't believe me
But now
The shimmer's gone somehow
Luster fades and gives way to truth... la la la lifted
Love can't stay on a higher ground
The fall from grace may not make a sound
Just pull me close... never let me down
I want a love that's lifted
The truth is there in loss that have retraced
But I'm not scared to part ways anymore
What's the use?
Searching for love when you're afraid
Doing it all to make sure your heart stays...
Love can't stay on a higher ground
The fall from grace may not make a sound
Just pull me close... never let me down
I want a love that's lifted

===================


I need more than
You need me don't you
Pretend that you don't mind
I'm gone without you
You feel without me
Your life would just go on
I'm a slave to your love
But I don't mind
Cause you make me feel safe
I'm a slave to your love
But I don't mind
Cause you make me feel so happy
Take me to the end
I'll chill about the side
Watch me fall for you
Until we'll chill
We brought it down
On the pavement
I'll need you now
To break my fall
I'm a slave to your love
But I don't mind
Cause you make me feel safe
I'm a slave to your love
But I don't mind
Cause you make me feel so happy

===================


When those shapes revolve
Lasers twinkle in your eyes
When those shapes revolve
Know that you're gonna be up here
Does it mesmerize your mind? [x2]
When those shapes revolve
Take a dance around your hand
When those shapes revolve
Should you see or feel the wind

===================


Slow down
Let me be still with you
Still with me

Slow down
Let me be still with you
Still with me

Still with me

Slow down
Let me be still with you
Still with me

Slow down
Let me be still with you
Still with me

===================


Before I met you woulda said I'm fine
If you asked, if you asked, if you asked me
And then you gave that word another life
Yeah you got, yeah you got, yeah you got me

I wore the pain on my face
Hoping someday it would fade
You know how to wash it away
Oh you do it
I wear the smile that you gave me
Won't take it off if you paid me
I wouldn't say that you saved me
But the truth is

Right when we met
You made me forget
That my heart was ever
Bro- broken
Looking at me
You wouldn't believe
That my heart was ever
Bro- broken

Before I met you I wouldn't sleep alone
But it felt, but it felt, but it felt like it
I moved my body, but my chest was stone
Couldn't break, couldn't break, couldn't break it

I wore the pain on my face
Hoping someday it would fade
You know how to wash it away
Oh you do it
I wear the smile that you gave me
Won't take it off if you paid me
I wouldn't say that you saved me
But the truth is

Right when we met
You made me forget
That my heart was ever
Bro- broken
Looking at me
You wouldn't believe
That my heart was ever
Bro- broken

Bro- broken

Only you can make me forget that my
Heart's been broke
You got me feeling like
Only you can make me forget that my
Heart was ever broken
Bro- broken

Right when we met
You made me forget
That my heart was ever
Bro- broken
Looking at me
You wouldn't believe
That my heart was ever
Bro- broken

Bro- broken

===================


Never know,
What you're gonna find.
Hearts collide,
Under coral skies.

Never thought,
We'd be here right now.
But I was meant,
To be by your side.

Waiting for you!
The way you make me feel.
You...
The way you make me...

Waiting for you!!
The way you make me feel.
You...
The way you make me...

Feel 
The way you make me...
Feel 
The way you make me...

Feel

I've been, waiting for you!

Feel

Breath by breath,
See it fall in line.
Deja vu,
Like connecting signs.

See the future,
Inside your eyes.
Leaving everything,
Else behind!

Waiting for you!!
The way you make me feel.
You...

Never know,
What you're gonna find.
Hearts collide,
Under coral skies.

Never thought,
We'd be here right now.
But I was meant,
To be by your side.

Waiting for you!
The way you make me feel.

===================


I've gone too many nights,
chasing the shadow of your silhouette
Moving just to survive,
All that I wanted was to start again

Stumbling through the crowd,
Feet lifting off the ground
Looking for you
Washing my fear away
Standing here face to face
Nothing to lose
I won't look back now

I feel the love
I wanna get to know you
I feel the love
Let the past burn into the sun
I feel the love
I really want to show you now

I feel the love
I wanna get to know you
I feel the love
Let the past burn into the sun
Can't get enough
So much I want to show you now

It's not over tonight,
stay in this moment we can hide away
Cos they're gonna turn on the lights
But we're burning bright
no we'll never fade

Stumbling through the crowd,
Feet lifting off the ground
Looking for you
Washing my fear away
Standing here face to face
Nothing to lose
I won't look back now

I feel the love
I wanna get to know you
I feel the love
Let the past burn into the sun
I feel the love
I really want to show you now

I feel the love
I wanna get to know you
I feel the love
Let the past burn into the sun
Can't get enough
So much I want to show you now

I feel the love
Can't get enough
I feel the love
I really want to show you now
I feel the love
I wanna get to know you
I feel the love
Let the past burn into the sun
Can't get enough
So much I want to show you now

===================


Doesn't take much to feel the rush
With nothing but your eyes on me
How 'bout we do just like we do
Two crazy fools just breaking free

No, it don't matter what we've been told
I can see the skies are gold
Yeah, it's just you and me and open road, let's go

I don't see no red lights, just a wild ride
You're my getaway, you're my getaway
Tonight I'm gonna be alright
You're my getaway, you're my getaway tonight
You're my getaway, you're my getaway tonight
You're my getaway tonight

You're my getaway
I don't see no red lights, just a wild ride
You're my getaway, you're my getaway
Tonight I'm gonna be alright
You're my getaway tonight

It's getting dark, let's light a spark
Ignite our hearts and burn away
This is our time, it's do or die
Come on, let's rise for heaven's sake

Oh, it don't matter what we've been told
I can see the skies are gold
Yeah, it's just you and me and open road, let's go

I don't see no red lights, just a wild ride
You're my getaway, you're my getaway
Tonight I'm gonna be alright
You're my getaway, you're my getaway tonight
You're my getaway, you're my getaway tonight
You're my getaway tonight

You're my getaway
I don't see no red lights, just a wild ride
You're my getaway, you're my getaway
Tonight I'm gonna be alright
You're my getaway, you're my getaway tonight
You're my getaway tonight

===================


Cause I know how to make you feel good, baby
Oh, baby

Cause I know how to make you feel good, baby
Oh, baby

Cause I know how to make you feel good, baby
Oh, baby

C'mon!

Cause I know how to make you feel good, baby
Oh, baby

Cause I know how to make you feel good, baby
Oh, baby

C'mon!

===================


They say we're reckless drivers
The way we smash before we've begun
We both fight fire with fire
To feel alive

Don't mind to break the speed limits
We're chasin' red flags, looking for something
That lasts longer than a minute
That lasts for life

We crash and we collide
Two stormy minds
We're nothing like the others
We're nothing like them
We jump and fall to feel it all
We're nothing like the others
We're nothing like them
Nothing like, nothing like
Them, them

With you it hurts, good I need it
To prove my heart that we are for real
I've never liked to think that's easy, no

We crash and we collide
Two stormy minds
We're nothing like the others
We're nothing like them
We jump and fall to feel it all
We're nothing like the others
We're nothing like them
Nothing like, nothing like
Them, them

We're nothing like them
We're nothing like them, no
We're nothing like them, no

===================


Two hungry hearts, a city divided
Pulled in the dark, so strong it was violent

Yeah, it was you and me, you and me against the world
It was you and me, you and me against the world

Don't you worry, baby, there's a fire for us
No, we're not going down on a blackout
And if the storm's above me crumble into dust
No, we're not going down in a blackout

System's down, the system's down
But we made light in a blackout

Oh no, no, no, the waves on the wire
Streets growing cold, cold
But we burn, burn brighter

Cause it's like you and me, you and me against the world
It's like you and me, you and me against the world

Don't you worry, baby, there's a fire for us
No, we're not going down on a blackout
And if the stars above me crumble into dust
No, we're not going down in a blackout

We made light in a, in a...
Going down, going down in a blackout
In a, in a...

Don't you worry, baby, there's a fire for us
No, we're not going down on a blackout
And if the stars above me, they crumble into dust
No, we're not going down in a blackout

===================


Wake up callin' in the middle of the night
She said, I can't sleep I wanna feel alive
She says she wants to dance in her party dress
So I follow her down to the other side

Don't wanna settle down, settle down
I just want somebody to hold onto
Don't wanna settle down, settle down
I want somebody like you

Love's a game of make-believe
Will you stay and play with me?
Can't stop once
We don't need sleep
Yeah, we're livin' the dream, livin' the dream
Livin' the dream, livin' the dream

(Livin' the dream, livin' the dream)

Baby you can smile, put your records on
Yeah, why don't cha dance to your favourite song
Chasin' down a feeling and we're still not done
I'll twirl you all night till the mornin' sun

Don't wanna settle down, settle down
I just want somebody to hold onto
Don't wanna settle down, settle down
I want somebody like you

Love's a game of make-believe
Will you stay and play with me?
Can't stop once
We don't need sleep
Yeah, we're livin' the dream, livin' the dream
Livin' the dream, livin' the dream

Can't stop once
We don't need sleep
Yeah, we're livin' the dream, livin' the dream
Livin' the dream, livin' the dream

===================


Tonight, lights won't die
When I'm in your eyes
I wanna feel you close
Tonight, gonna make it right
These tears will dry
You're all I wanna know

Just like stars collide
I'm running into you
You're running into me
You're a force I can't deny
Let's lose ourselves in gravity

You can have all of me
So take me on tonight
And baby that's all I need
To make me come alive

Your love, your love
Is my energy, my energy
Your love, your love
Is my energy, my energy

Right now, we're bringing down
The speed of sound
Losing all control
Right here, the sound's so clean
I could disappear
Free fall into your soul

Just like stars collide
I'm running into you
You're running into me
You're a force I can't deny
Let's lose ourselves in gravity

You can have all of me
So take me on tonight
And baby that's all I need
To make me come alive

Your love, your love
Is my energy, my energy
Your love, your love
Is my energy, my energy

Your love, your love
Is my energy, my energy
Your love, your love
Is my energy, my energy

Just like stars collide
I'm running into you
You're running into me

===================


There's she kind of lost
In the white wash
Did the city lights blind you, blind you?
The king may have his horses
The king may have his knights
But only we can put our hearts back together, together
Where are we gonna go?
Anywhere we want to!

Tonight, the world is coming down
Oh, we gonna set it on fire
Oh, we gonna set it on fire
Tonight, the world is coming down
Oh, we're gonna set it on fire
Oh, we're gonna set it on fire

Now, that I'm older
See, I've got a plan
The seasons, summer's bolder
Then I long her,
Then I long her
Don't, I believe it
'Cause we got a heart
That we, don't even, understand
I left your name at the door
I'll see you back at the show

Tonight, the world is coming down
Oh, we're gonna set it on fire
Oh, we're gonna set it on fire
Tonight, the world is coming down
Oh, we're gonna set it on fire
Oh, we're gonna set it on fire

===================


Oh, they're onto us
They know we wanna go
So let's prove them right
Take off and hit the road

When they open their mouth bullshit comes out
But I don't hear a thing
Oh it's all just a game they want us to play
But we don't aim to please

We can, we can escape this
We can run right through the chains, yeah
Right here, right now we're breaking
All the crazy rules that they're making
We can, we can escape this
We can run right through the chains, yeah
Right here, right now we're breaking
All the fucking rules that they're making

(Right through the chains, yeah)

Now we're all alone
Just us and flashing lights
Can you feel the rush all over us inside

When they open their mouth bullshit comes out
But I don't hear a thing
Oh it's all just a game they want us to play
But we don't aim to please

We can, we can escape this
We can run right through the chains, yeah
Right here, right now we're breaking
All the crazy rules that they're making
We can, we can escape this
We can run right through the chains, yeah
Right here, right now we're breaking
All the fucking rules that they're making

I can hear your voice through the static
Every time you move I feel your magic
I'm coming back to you, more than a habit
Bringing me to life

I was at my low
Falling through the shadows, losing all control
Now I feel the light
You came along and saved me, opened up my eyes

'Cause you found me, yeah, you found me
You found me, yeah, you found me
You found me, yeah, you found me
You found me, yeah, you found me
You found me, yeah, you found me

You found me, yeah

'Cause you found me, yeah

I was in the dark, slowly fading
Nothing left to lose, close to breaking
But when you pull me close, there's no mistaking
You can set me free

I was at my low
Falling through the shadows, losing all control
Now I feel the light
You came along and saved me, opened up my eyes

I wish you could inhale me like the cigarette you gave me
That night in December
Got colder, was frozen, you wrapped your arms around me
I know you remember

We've been on that on and off thing
We can go for weeks no talking
But it's been a month, I'm wondering
No complications, but do you feel like I do?
'Cause when I'm with you
When I'm with you

Everything's cool when I'm with you

Wanna get loose when I'm with you

It's been a minute since I met you
Don't know why we ever let go?
'Cause I ain't met nobody like you
Body like you, no no

I thought you were keeping your distance cuz we were moving too quick
But that wasn't it
No, your next move
Was showing off somebody new like I don't exist
Now you're back again

You're the question mark that I could live without, be better off
Honestly, no honestly
Had me at the start and then you shut me down
So what you want?
Honestly, no no honestly

It's a hard pass, baby
I don't feel bad
No, I don't need that
Can't wait til you see that you can't get me back
A hard pass, baby

I still remember that feeling
Where we stared up at your ceiling
I know you could hear my heart beating
Beating through my chest
Yeah, that's where it all started
In your studio apartment
And I don't gotta tell you
You know what happened next

You hit me tonight
Like a bullet from the bright night sky
You saw me fall down
You saw me die
The days went by
And the world was changing
Opened my eyes
To the bullet that saved me
The days went by
And the world was fading
Opened my eyes
When the bullet saved me

===================


Used to drive up Topanga
Real late at night
It's hard breaking the habit of stopping by
Wanna dial up your number
One more time
Just to see how your day was
And say goodnight

'Cause I keep thinking about you
Every hour
Everyday
And I've been living without you
Wish I could call
And take the blame
Yeah keep missing about you
Everything in every way
I know I thought it through
But I hated leaving you

I never go back to Calabasas
I never go back
I never go back
I loved it every minute that it lasted
You're never coming back
You're never coming back
I never go back to Calabasas
Calabasas

To let you go
Wish I could give up the pieces

So they dance from your eyes like shadows in the night
Don't be surround the stars
We were running in the haze I remember every shade in my veins
Shut up sparks, what's fell from your lips
What I heard it's only noise in the dark
Like when you looked away I remember every shade
So let your colors run tonight, the painting in the dark
Let your colors run tonight, the colors of your heart
Let your colors run tonight, their painting in the dark
Let you colors run tonight, the colors of your heart
So they dance from your eyes like shadows in the night
Don't be surround the stars
We were running in the haze I remember every shade in my veins
Shut up sparks, what's fell from your lips
What I heard it's only noise in the dark
Like when you looked away I remember every shade
So let your colors run tonight, their painting in the dark
Let your colors run tonight, the colors of your heart
Let your colors run tonight, their painting in the dark
Let you colors run tonight, the colors of your heart

===================


We are running like animals waiting to spark
But I see your reflection colour the dark
Now I'm pushing through oceans
I'll find a way
To the beautiful trace I was imagining
I feel your electric glow
I feel your electric glow
Takes me to a place I don't know
Your electric
[Repeat]
Your electric glow
I feel your
I feel your electric glow, glow, glow
Electric glow, glow, glow
Electric glow, glow, glow
Electric glow
Come alive in the moment we collide
Come alive in the moment we collide
I feel your electric glow
I feel your electric glow
Takes me to a place I don't know
Your electric
[Repeat]
Your electric glow
I feel your electric glow, glow, glow
Electric glow, glow, glow
Electric glow, glow, glow
Electric glow
I feel your electric glow, glow, glow
Electric glow, glow, glow
Electric glow, glow, glow
Electric glow
Your electric
Your electric glow

===================


A sinking stone you are at sea
An ocean of tears is hard to believe
I found your heart in the blackest hole
It always shine like a crystal sea
Breaking the surface and setting you free
We live the moment revives the dream
Follow me home
Follow me home 
Follow me home
A sinking stone you are at sea
An ocean of tears is hard to believe
I found your heart in the blackest hole
It always shine like a crystal sea
Breaking the surface and setting you free
We live the moment revives the dream
Follow me home
Follow me home

===================


Don't know how it's supposed to be
But I can feel you turn me round
If love can go sideways
Look back at me and I won't let you down

I, I couldn't find what I was missing
In the open sea
I saw so many sharks out where I'm fishing
But maybe you're the one for me

The only good thing I see is you, you, you
Good thing it's only me and you, you, you
I know you're good for me, I think I'm good for you
So let's see what tonight brings, maybe it's a good thing so
Good thing, good thing
Maybe it's a good thing so
Good thing, good thing
Maybe it's a good thing so

Don't care if it's right or wrong
'Cause either way it's enough
If we know how to make mistakes
Then we belong inside this life of love

I, I couldn't find what I was missing
In the open sea
I saw so many sharks out where I'm fishing
But maybe you're the one for me

The only good thing I see is you, you, you
Good thing it's only me and you, you, you
I know you're good for me, I think I'm good for you
So let's see what tonight brings, maybe it's a good thing so
Good thing, good thing
Maybe it's a good thing so
Good thing, good thing
Maybe it's a good thing so

The only good thing I see is you, you, you
You, you, you
The only good thing, you, you, you
Is you, you, you, you

Only good thing I see is you
Good thing, good thing
Maybe it's a good thing so
Good thing, good thing
Maybe it's a good thing so

===================


Touched my skin and left your mark
You knew all the words to say
Held the strings tied to my heart
Pulled then pushed away
My friends don't bring you up no more
I'm sure yours don't mention me
I remember how we were before
It don't feel like memories

Why can't I get over, over you?
Your love is a fire, still high on the fumes
I've done everything and all I can do
I'm still hung up on you, I'm still hung up
I'm still hung up on you
I'm still hung up on you
Why can't I get over, over you?
Your love is a fire, still high on the fumes
I've done everything and all I can do
I'm still hung up on you, I'm still hung up
I'm still hung up

Do you ever ask what if?
Do you almost call?
I'm not the only one who feels crazy
'Cause I still miss it all

Why can't I get over, over you?
Your love is a fire, still high on the fumes
I've done everything and all I can do
I'm still hung up on you, I'm still hung up on you

Bags underneath my eyes
All of these sleepless nights
Without you in my life
Nothing I haven't tried
To get you off my mind
There's no good reason why

I'm still hung up on you
I'm still hung up on you

Why can't I get over, over you?
Your love is a fire, still high on the fumes
I've done everything and all I can do
I'm still hung up on you, I'm still hung up
I'm still hung up
I'm still hung up on you
I'm still hung up
I'm still hung up on you
I'm still hung up on you
I'm still hung up on you
I'm still hung up on you
I'm still hung up on you
I'm still hung up

===================


Why do you always gotta be right
Pissed off when you don't win a fight
Yeah I see it in your selfish eyes
But that's just my type

And I've been setting fires, setting fires
Yeah, you've been crossing lines
But you know that I like it
Maybe I'm just like you
Maybe I'm just like you

Hearts are made to break
People always change
But it's okay
'Cause we love the same

Maybe I'm just like you
Maybe you're like me too
Maybe you're like me too...

Always thinking you can change my mind
Pissed off when I can't win a fight
But I'm no good at compromise
Don't lie you like it

'Cause we've been setting fires, setting fires
Yeah, you've been crossing lines
But you know that I like it
Maybe I'm just like you
Maybe I'm just like you

Hearts are made to break
People always change
But it's okay
'Cause we love the same

Maybe I'm just like you
Maybe you're like me too
Maybe you're like me too...

Give in to me and I'll give into you
I'll give you all of me
If you give me all of you, yeah
Give in to me as I give into you
I'll give you all of me
'Cause I'm just like you too
Just like you

Maybe you're like me too
Just like you, just like you...
Yeah, yeah

===================


How come that love is so cruel, is so evil?
I wanna hide in the dark
I keep patching up the walls of my ego
But not the walls in my heart

I'm six feet underground, but I'm breathing
Heavy is the thought of my freedom
There's something inside me that wants to get out
I can feel it, I'm feeling it now

I'm changing, if only just a little
I'm breaking, it hurts to let it heal
I'll never be the same
No, I'll never be the same
'Cause I'm changing, if only just a little
I'm breaking, it hurts to let it heal
I'll never be the same
No, I'll never, never, never

(Oh-oh-oh)
No, I'll never be the same
No, I'll never be
(Oh-oh-oh)
No, I'll never be the same
No, I'll never be
(Oh-oh-oh)
No, I'll never be the same
No, I'll never be
(Oh-oh-oh)
No, I'll never, I'll never be the same

How come silence is so loud in the shadows?
I wanna scream 'til it's on
Tell my feet they should run, but they don't follow
I think it's time to get out

I'm six feet underground, but I'm breathing
Heavy is the thought of my freedom
There's something inside me that wants to get out
I can feel it, I'm feeling it now

I'm changing, if only just a little
I'm breaking, it hurts to let it heal
I'll never be the same
No, I'll never be the same
'Cause I'm changing, if only just a little
I'm breaking, it hurts to let it heal
I'll never be the same
No, I'll never be the same

No, I'll never be the same

(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
No, I'll never be the same

===================


The walls are paper-thin, you’re moving in
I can see right through somehow, it all makes sense
Me caving in, but I barely know you

I’d rather have one night,
Than nothing forever
Yeah, that would be alright, with me
It’s now or never
I’d rather have one night,
Than nothing forever
Yeah, that would be alright, with me
It’s now or never [x3]

Like Planets in the dark
We don't know how we got here in the sky
Like magnets torn apart,
You don't know why you come back every time

I’d rather have one night,
Than nothing forever
Yeah, that would be alright, with me
It’s now or never
I’d rather have one night,
Than nothing forever
Yeah, that would be alright, with me
It’s now or never [x3]

When your world's colliding
Crashing from the sky
I'll be your satellite
To guide you home
No, you are not alone
Though it's right
There is no hope inside
I'll be your satellite to let you know
You are not alone...

===================


Strangers, strangers, strangers
We could be, we could be

Make believe, come on we can play make believe
Same body, no identity, like we don't have a history (history)
Chemistry's better when we had a mystery
Ditched the familiarity and you see, you see

I I I'm curious to try
Can we pretend tonight we're just strangers
Shameless behavior
We could be strangers
Sipping on sex and smoking on danger
Shameless behavior
We could be strangers

Strangers, strangers, strangers
We could be, we could be
Strangers, strangers, strangers

Got me high, got me high off of your disguise
Love how you got me feeling like, like I'm somebody else tonight
Play your role, you look good when you lose control
Tell me something nobody knows and let go, let go

You, you, I know you like it too
Can we pretend tonight we're just strangers
Shameless behavior
We could be strangers
Sipping on sex and smoking on danger
Shameless behavior
We could be strangers

Strangers, strangers, strangers
We could be, we could be
Strangers, strangers, strangers

We can be strangers
We could be, we could be
Strangers, strangers, strangers

Can we pretend tonight we're just strangers
Shameless behavior
We could be strangers
Sipping on sex and smoking on danger
Shameless behavior
We could be strangers

Strangers, strangers, strangers
We could be, we could be
Strangers, strangers, strangers

Can we pretend tonight we're just strangers
Shameless behavior
We could be strangers

===================


We've been wondering in the dark
A million miles apart going nowhere
Believe that even if we're lost
You know it won't be long 'til we get there
Spinning 'round no control
Burning down, letting go
We've been wondering in the dark
But no matter where we are, just remember

We rise and we fall
We'll stay, we'll stay untouchable
Yeah, after it all
We'll stay, we'll stay untouchable

Time is slipping through our hands
We're sinking in the sands of forever
Light, surrender to the dark
But we can make a spark here together
Hanging on by a thread
We will climb back again
Time is slipping through our hands
It's hard to understand, but remember

===================


Baby I can't be what you want me to be
I've given you everything I sailed the sea
Baby there's fireworks in my heart setting off
Darling I wish
You hadn't let us fall apart

I promise I try to let this go
But I can't breathe
If only you knew how much I give you everything
You need
So in the space and time around us to waste
Baby I think I'm losing you
I can see it in your face

Don't leave
Don't leave
I need you
And I need you
Eh...

And I
And I need you
'Cause lately you've been the world to me
I need you
'Cause lately you've got the best of me

Fall apart, fall apart, fall apart

Don't leave
Don't leave

I promise I try to let this go
But I can't breathe
If only you knew how much I give you everything
You need
So in the space and time around us to waste
Baby I think I'm losing you
I can see it in your face

Don't leave
Don't leave
I need you
And I need you
I need you

Fall apart, fall apart, fall apart

Don't leave
Don't leave

===================


I keep reaching
But you're not reaching back
You're not reaching back

Trying to get in, find you through the cracks [2x]

Guess I'm trying to say [2x]
It hurts to feel this far [2x]
Million miles away
Next to me, next to me you are

And if you're sitting right here,
Then why are we worlds apart?
Why are we worlds apart?
If you're so near,
Why do you feel this far?
Why are we worlds apart?

Oh
We're not that different, you know.
I play among the stars and then fall so low
I try to make sense as I go
'Cause nothing, 'cause nothing, 'cause nothing is in your soul

Why are we worlds apart? [3x]

Why are we?
Why are we worlds apart? [2x]

Guess I'm trying to say [2x]
It hurts to feel this far [2x]
Million miles away
Next to me, next to me you are

And if you're sitting right here,
Why are we worlds apart [2x]
Oh, if you're so near,
Why do you feel this far?
Why are we worlds apart?

Why are we worlds apart? [3x]
Why are we?
Why are we worlds apart? [2x]

===================


Nothing more than strangers 
Passing by out on the street
Memories are fading though 
It's only been a week
All the little things are gone 
The things we used to be
Nobody could take us down 
There was only you and me

And without you I can't be
You're the universe to me
You're the air in my lungs
You're the fields where I run
You're the sky where I'm floating

It's you, you, you
It's you, woah

And without you I can't be
You're the universe to me
You're the air in my lungs
You're the fields where I run
You're the sky where I'm floating

It's you, you, you
It's you, woah

Don't want to be a stranger
Want to be the one you need
I can be your world, your life
Your lover, all for free
All the little things come back
The things we used to be
Nobody can take us down there
It's only you and me

And without you I can't be
You're the universe to me
You're the air in my lungs
You're the fields where I run
You're the sky where I'm floating

===================


Through the thunder
Through the rain
Dreading battlefields
Say you'll remain

Keep it close
Stay cold

Keep it close
When they're coming for us
When they're coming for us
Stay cold
Stay cool

Keep it close
Stay cold

Bruised in ashes
In the dust
Hold your miracles
Glimmering through the rust

Keep it close
When they're coming for us
When they're coming for us
Stay cold
When they're coming for us
When they're coming for us

Stay cool

===================


There, was a Time
We were strong as storm
Pure, by design
So unbreakable
Now I see the grains, of sand
Slipping through the cracks
Staring at the edge of all we have

Who can save us from ourselves
Cause we're running out of time
And I cannot watch us die
Ohhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
Is this the end
Of everything
Ohhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
Is this the end
Of everything
Ohhh ahhh ahhh ahhh

There was a time

Ohhh ahhh ahhh ahhh

Of everything
Ohhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
Is this the end
Of everything
Ohhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
(Are we broken, words unspoken)

Who can save us
Cause we're running out of time
Who can save us

Is this the end
Of everything
Ohhh ahhh ahhh ahhh

===================


Under rocks and memories
Underneath desire
I found what I'm missing in your fire

Up above the skyline
High above the lights
You become the echo of my life

Ooh oh oh oh oh, I wanna lose myself inside you
Ooh oh oh oh oh, I couldn't let you go if I tried to
You fly me so high, I look down below
The shadow of night hides the way that we glow
Ooh oh oh oh oh, I wanna lose myself inside you

Oh oh oh, just keep breathing, just keep breathing
Oh oh oh, all these feelings, all these feelings
Oh oh oh, just keep breathing, just keep breathing
Oh oh oh, all these feelings, all these feelings

You fly me so high, I look down below
The shadow of night hides the way that we glow
Ooh oh oh oh oh, I wanna lose myself inside you

I wanna lose myself inside you

Oh oh oh, just keep breathing, just keep breathing
Oh oh oh, all these feelings, all these feelings
Oh oh oh, just keep breathing, just keep breathing
Oh oh oh

Out of ashes rising
Out of breath with you
In the end I'm finding the perfect truth

Into every sunrise
Into every moon
I know that you'll be coming with me soon

Ooh oh oh oh oh, I wanna lose myself inside you
Ooh oh oh oh oh, I couldn't let you go if I tried to
You fly me so high, I look down below
The shadow of night hides the way that we glow
Ooh oh oh oh oh, I wanna lose myself inside you

Oh oh oh, just keep breathing, just keep breathing
Oh oh oh, all these feelings, all these feelings
Oh oh oh, just keep breathing, just keep breathing
Oh oh oh, all these feelings, all these feelings

You fly me so high, I look down below
The shadow of night hides the way that we glow
Ooh oh oh oh oh, I wanna lose myself inside you

===================


I saw
Your breath
Decorate the air

Snow blind
We love
A fire burning down

I gave
My breath
On your lips it froze

My heart
We love
A fire in the snow

Meet me once more
Where we met before
It's growing colder
Will you remember
To fall like the snow
Holding me close
Bring me winter
My dear December

Meet me once more
Where we met before
It's growing colder
Will you remember
To fall like the snow
Holding me close
Bring me winter
Bring me winter

My dear December

My dear December
My dear December
My dear December
My dear December

Meet me once more
Where we met before
It's growing colder
Will you remember
To fall like the snow
Holding me close
Bring me winter
Bring me winter

My dear December
My dear December

I saw
Your breath
Decorate the air

Snow blind
We love
A fire burning down

I gave
My breath
On your lips it froze

My heart
We love
A fire in the snow

===================


Teardrops are racing our stopwatch
Our hope is in a headlock
Tomorrow always comes too soon
And it kills to say I knew you'd let me down
As I fumble for the words to say so long, for now
Well, every love song will be sung about you
And every July will go cold without you
And I'll hold on to every piece of you
That I made up in my mind
Until I find a way to say goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
A way to say goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
A way to say goodbye

Well, every love song will be sung about you
And every July will go cold without you
And I'll hold on to every piece of you
That I made up in my mind
Until I find a way to say goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
A way to say goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
A way to say goodbye

===================


Locked inside the emptiness
Far away from creation
Forever floating alone
I am the source of it all
Beginning to all ends
Creating chemicals

And I want you to fear me
And I want you to know
I am everywhere you go
Can't hide from me no more
I am everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere you go
And I want you to fear me
And I want you to know

My name, my name
My name, my name

I am everywhere you go
Can't hide from me no more
I am everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere you go

Locked inside the emptiness
Far away from creation
Forever floating alone
I am the sun, your only one
On which you trust, our time is up
So far away, so far away

And I want you to fear me
And I want you to know

===================


Time it slips from fingertips
I tore her dress, threw it to the floor
I'm in love with every open door
I'm sorry

It's cold as hell on the other side of this bed
Twisted up in sheets, demons in my head
I wanna know you, oh let me come back
I'm sorry I slid off the track

I'm hopeless without you
Hopeless without you
Hopeless without you so
I'm coming home, I'm coming home!

I'm coming home, I'm coming home!
I'm coming home, I'm coming home!
I'm coming home, I'm coming home!
I'm coming home, I'm coming home!

Wide awake and I can't sleep
Shaking fevers from these broken dreams
Baby, could you forgive me for what I lost?
Could you forgive me?

It's cold as hell on the other side of this bed
Twisted up in sheets, demons in my head
I wanna know you, oh let me come back
I'm sorry I slid off the track

I'm hopeless without you
Hopeless without you
Hopeless without you so
I'm coming home, I'm coming home!

I'm coming home, I'm coming home!
I'm coming home, I'm coming home!
I'm coming home, I'm coming home!
I'm coming home, I'm coming home!

===================


I didn't want to think
Cause I knew I was out of my mind
You pulled me from the break
And brought me to the other side

And I
Think we're there
And I
Think we're there

So goodnight goodnight
Don't have to have it all figured out
We'll be alright
What comes back is gonna come back
Tomorrow when we meet
Just take me to a place I've never been
Find me in the sweetest oblivion

Oh, oh
We have it all
In front of us
And I can't see the
Sun is up to cover us
I'm lifted up
Take me to a beautiful day
And I feel like our
Shadow is falling away
Falling away [x5]

So goodnight goodnight
Don't have to have it all figured out
We'll be alright
What comes back is gonna come back

We have it all

Didn't see a warning
Hits me in the morning
Puts me in the moment, the moment
Didn't find a reason
Hits me in the evening
Hurts me when I breathe in, I breathe in

Feel the way that I do about you
Don't want anything new what I knew
Hits me in the morning
Puts me in the moment

Just look at me now
The sun setting gold
Look at me now
I'm freesol
Look at me now
The sun setting gold
Look at me now
I'm freesol

Look at me now

Take a breath I can feel it now
Raise my head I'm not looking down
Everything is shining out in the woods
Where I won't be found
Take a breath I can feel it now
Raise my head I'm not looking down
Everything is shining out in the woods
Where I won't be found [x8]
In the woods where I won't be found

I feel the sun I feel the sound but I'm
Walking on the wire
Walking on the wire
And I can fly and I can run but I'm
Walking on the wire
Walking on the wire
I feel the sun I feel the sound but I'm
Walking on the wire

They don't ever teach us heartache
Even though it's gonna hurt
Show me everything you've guarded
'Cause I got to know, I got to know
Tell me all you know about it
Let me see you at your worst
'Cause they never teach us heartache
But I got to know, I got to know

In the dark, in the dark
You all pretend
I won't know who you are when we descend
Tell me have you loved someone
Have you ever really loved someone?
In the dark, in the dark
You'll see the light
Untether your heart so we can fly
Tell me have you loved someone, loved someone

Slow dive into me
Float high endlessly
Hearts will shake
Wide awake
Love me till the tether breaks
Slow dive follow me
Always endlessly
Hearts will shake
Wide awake
Love me till the tether breaks

Slow dive into me
Float high endlessly
Slow dive follow me
Hearts will shake
Wide awake
Love me till the tether breaks

They don't ever teach us heartache
Even though it's gonna burn
Tell me where the love departed
'Cause I got to know, I got to know

Slow dive into me
Float high endlessly
Hearts will shake
Wide awake
Love me till the tether breaks
Slow dive follow me
Always endlessly
Hearts will shake
Wide awake
Love me till the tether breaks

In the dark, in the dark
You all pretend
I won't know who you are when we descend
Tell me have you loved someone
Have you ever really loved someone?
In the dark, in the dark
You'll see the light
Untether your heart so we can fly
Tell me have you loved someone, loved someone

Slow dive into me

Slow dive into me
Float high endlessly
Slow dive follow me
Hearts will shake
Wide awake
Love me till the tether breaks

===================


Like the moon shines
But fades in the daylight
Will fade in your eyes
Like a sun shines
Embrace its last light
Have a doubt in your mind
And like the fall lines
Break from the inside
Have we broken this time?

Like the moon shines
But fades in the daylight
Have we reached the sunlight?
Give me a heart so I could bleed
Give me the stars so I could dream
Who will I be without you?
Who will I be without you?
Give me a heart so I could bleed
Give me the stars so I could dream
Who will I be without you?
Who will I be without you?

Hoping this sun won't rise
Hoping this sun won't rise
I'm hoping the sun won't
Sun won't, sun won't rise
I'm hoping this sun won't
Hoping this sun won't
I'm hoping the sun won't
Sun won't, sun won't rise

Who will I be without you?
Who will I be without you?
Who will I be without you?
Who will I be without you?

===================


Running 'round in circles, don't need know which way to go
Caught up in the motion with feelings I-I can't control

Tried to contain all this overflow
Watch me spill over and float
A million pieces, a million pieces

Know I can't be trusted to wear it on my sleeve
Know I can't be trusted to say just what I mean
All that I am asking for
You don't rescue me
All that I am asking for
You don't rescue me
All that I am asking for
You don't rescue me
All that I am asking for
You don't rescue me
All that I am asking for

All that I am asking for
All that I am asking for
All that I am asking for
All that I am asking for
All that I am asking for
All that I am asking for
All that I am asking for
All that I am asking for

Caught up in the moment of what I want
Can't let go, 'til I got a motive
It's what you want, what you're waiting for

Tried to contain all this overflow
Watch me spill over and float
A million pieces, a million pieces

Know I can't be trusted to wear it on my sleeve
Know I can't be trusted to say just what I mean
All that I am asking for
You don't rescue me
All that I am asking for
You don't rescue me
All that I am asking for
You don't rescue me
All that I am asking for
You don't rescue me
All that I am asking for

You don't rescue me
You don't rescue me
You don't rescue me
You don't rescue me
All that I am asking for

All that I am asking for
All that I am asking for
All that I am asking for
All that I am asking for
All that I am asking for
All that I am asking for
All that I am asking for
All that I am asking for

===================


I said I'd be right here
I'd keep for all our years a ship through time
Your eyes betray all your fears, flood with all our tears
The tides were high

I can't be without you my love
Oh I can't be without you my love
Without you my love (without you my love)
Without you my love (without you my love)
Oh I can't be without you my love
Without you my love (without you my love)
Without you my love (without you my love)
Oh I can't be without you my love

Without you my love
Without you my love
Without you my love
Without you my love
Oh I can't be without you my love

I can't be without you my love
Oh I can't be without you my love
Without you my love (without you my love)
Without you my love (without you my love)
Oh I can't be without you my love
Without you my love (without you my love)
Without you my love (without you my love)
Oh I can't be without you my love

Without you my love
Without you my love
Without you my love (Oh I)
Without you my love (Oh I)
Oh I can't be without you my love

===================


Oh you're stars away from yesterday
Like a tidal wave
It'll break the pain
So let go, let go

Under silent skies I hear the echo of your heart again
Every tear you cry just drips away
Won't you lift up the lights
Come back to life
If you never thought you'd see the end
So lift up the light won't you hold me tonight again
Under silent skies

Silent skies
Silent skies

Under silent skies I hear the echo of your heart again
Every tear you cry just drips away
Won't you lift up the lights
Come back to life
If you never thought you'd see the end
So lift up the light won't you hold me tonight again
Under silent skies

Under silent skies
Silent skies
Silent skies

===================


Stood by the river and watched it go dry
We watched it go dry
Out lost on the tide
Time and again kept the embers on fire
The harder we tried
We held them too tight

So we waited for rain
But it never came
I know that some things never change
So we're here in the dust
And I can't seem to trust
Anything will ever change

Maybe this is just the time to say goodbye
Maybe this is just the time to say goodbye
Maybe this is just the time to say goodbye
Surrender as we let go
Maybe this is just the time to say goodbye
Maybe this is just the time to say goodbye
Maybe this is just the time to say goodbye
Surrender as we let go
Surrender as we let go
Surrender as we let go
Surrender as we let go

As we let go
We let go
As we let go
We let go

As we let go
As we let go
As we let go
As we let go
As we let go
As we let go

===================


I'll go, don't wait for my return
You should stay here, safe where you belong
Although, now I can't find the words
You believe, oh tell me I was wrong

This is how it ends
I will leave you different than before
This is how it ends
You have changed me more than you can know

The cold breeze between us
Falling at our feet
For all we could be then
You left me incomplete
And time is not on our side
Another day won't stand the tide
And I can't wait till you decide

As we face down the end
Rise and start again
As we face down the end
As we face down the end
As we face down the end
Rise and start again

As we face down the end
As we face down the end
As we face down the end
As we face down the end

Time is not on our side
Another day won't stand the tide
And I can't wait till you decide

As we face down the end
Rise and start again
As we face down the end
As we face down the end
As we face down the end
Rise and start again

As we face down the end
As we face down the end
As we face down the end
As we face down the end

As we face down the end
As we face down the end
Rise and start again

===================


So you're looking through the window
Premonition all the light from worlds apart
All the stories in your pipe trees
Came to life for me in moments after dark
So you're sleeping in my nightmares
Premonition all the light from worlds apart
All the stories in your pipe trees
Came to life for me in moments after dark

Came to life for me in moments after dark
Came to life for me in moments after dark
Came to life for me in moments after dark

So you're looking through the window
Premonition all the light from worlds apart
All the stories in your pipe trees
Came to life for me in moments after dark
So you're sleeping in my nightmares
Premonition all the light from worlds apart
All the stories in your pipe trees
Came to life for me in moments after dark

Came to life for me in moments after dark
Came to life for me in moments after dark
Came to life for me in moments after dark
Came to life for me in moments after dark

===================


I know you're looking for the better place
You will see that I'll be right here by your side
All the thoughts that take you into space
All your prophecies and all your fears aside

If it could be enough
I'll wrap you up in the honesty
Just for the two of us
You'll never taste it bittersweet

And for all the days to come
Every single moment better than before
All the truth to meet the sun
I can tell you that I've never been so sure

Cause you've got me dreamin'
And all that I'm feeling
That symphony healing
Yeah, you've got me dreamin'

So tell me you need it
Cause I can't believe that
My heart's at the ceiling
Cause you've got me dreamin'

Yeah, you've got me dreamin'
And all that I'm feeling
That symphony healing
And you've got me, got me so

So tell me you need it
Cause I can't believe that
My heart's at the ceiling
Cause you've got me dreamin'

You've got me dreamin'
You've got me, got me to
You've got me dreamin'
You've got me dreamin'

If it could be enough
I'll wrap you up in the honesty
Just for the two of us
You'll never taste it bittersweet

Yeah, you've got me dreamin'
And all that I'm feeling
That symphony healing
And you've got me, got me so

So tell me you need it
Cause I can't believe that
My heart's at the ceiling
Cause you've got me dreamin'
Cause you've got me dreamin'
Cause you've got me dreamin'

Cause you've got me dreamin'
You've got me dreamin'
You've got me, got me to
You've got me dreamin'
You've got me dreamin'

===================


Is this what you want, is it what you need?
Maybe everything isn't what it seems
All this back and forth makes me wanna scream, baby
Scream, baby

Do you feel the rush, do you feel the high
Coming from my touch, feels like paradise
When you say my name it makes me come alive, baby

This is the way that it goes, dear
Everything becomes so clear
You never wanted to stay here
You had one foot out the door
And I might sound crazy
But this is the way that you made me
I'm sorry that you couldn't change me

You won't find another me
You won't find another me

And I might sound crazy
But this is the way that you made me
I'm sorry that you couldn't change me

You won't find another me
You won't find another me

Now that you're alone, do you feel the pain?
Feeling the regret flowing through your veins
Does the thought of me make you go insane, babe
Insane

And when you wanna call, I hope you don't
You hope I'll take you back but you know I won't
Once you let me go I'm not coming home

This is the way that it goes, dear
Everything becomes so clear
You never wanted to stay here
You had one foot out the door
And I might sound crazy
But this is the way that you made me
I'm sorry that you couldn't change me

You won't find another me
You won't find another me

===================


Home, my heart is homeless
I'm made out of stones
Since you've been gone
Hope, I'm wasted and hopeless
I drink for the soulless
Shell and one

For you, my love
Is it true or not?
I need to hear you, my love
It's up to you

We were drifters, dancing through the dark
Then the whole world went silent around me
I followed sirens, followed all the sparks
And the whole world was silent around me

For you, my love
Is it true or not?
I need to hear you, my love
It's up to you
To break the silence

Break the silence
It's up to you

Time, I'm trapped and I'm timeless
Unreachable kind of
State of mind
The end, I follow the endless
Path of pretenders
I'm not fine

For you, my love
Is it true or not?
I need to hear you, my love
It's up to you

We were drifters, dancing through the dark
Then the whole world went silent around me
I followed sirens, followed all the sparks
And the whole world was silent around me

For you, my love
Is it true or not?
I need to hear you, my love
It's up to you
To break the silence

Break the silence
Break the silence

===================


Feel the waves over my head
I'm into the deep
Fading fast, but running right back
Can't you see

That it's all my heart can take
Learn from my mistakes
Scared that it's too late
So please

Don't say it's the end of the story
Don't say it's the end of the road
Cause as long as you're there to hold me
I'll always be calling you home
Don't know what's waiting before me
But I don't have to go it alone
Cause as long as you're there to hold me
I'll always be calling you home

In the dark, I'm losing my way
I need your light
I know it's hard, but baby don't fade
It's worth the fight

'Cause it's all my heart can take
Learn from my mistakes
Scared that it's too late
So please

Don't say it's the end of the story
Don't say it's the end of the road
Cause as long as you're there to hold me
I'll always be calling you home
Don't know what's waiting before me
But I don't have to go it alone
Cause as long as you're there to hold me
I'll always be calling you home

Calling you home
Calling you home

Feel the waves over my head
I'm into the deep
Fading fast, but running right back
Can't you see

That is all my heart can take
Learn from my mistakes
Scared that it's too late
So please

Don't say it's the end of the story
Don't say it's the end of the road
Cause as long as you're there to hold me
I'll always be calling you home
Don't know what's waiting before me
But I don't have to go it alone
Cause as long as you're there to hold me
I'll always be calling you home

Always be calling you home
Always be calling you home
Calling you home
Calling you home

===================


Here I am again
Floating through the silence in my cold skin
Our bodies wearing thin
My fears tell me I'll never win
Our bodies wearing thin
Wearing thin

And there's darkness here (darkness here)
The whole world I fear (I fear)
And my rumors seem to drown (to drown)
But I won't let them take me down
I won't let them take me down
Down, down, down, oh

I won't let them take me down
(Down, down, down, down, down)
I won't let them take me down

I'll rise and I'll fall again
Fighting off the violence in my cold skin
Our bodies wearing thin
My fears tell me I'll never win
Our bodies wearing thin
Wearing thin

And there's darkness here (darkness here)
The whole world I fear (I fear)
And my rumors seem to drown (to drown)
But I won't let them take me down
I won't let them take me down
Down, down, down, oh

I won't let them take me down
(Down, down, down, down, down)
I won't let them take me down

===================


We run, faces to the wind
It'll get easier
When you breathe it in
Fall, gently give in
Swallow in the air
And rain on skin

Hurts will come undone
All that will become
Rise and fall behind
Weightless in rewind

I feel the shifting of you getting closer
My eyes wide open underneath the sun
Follow the feeling, but patiently waiting
I lose my feelings to oblivion

Days, I feel it,
Days, I feel it,
Quietly I keep you close to me
Quietly I feel you when I'm dreaming
Quietly I keep you close to me
Quietly I feel you when I'm dreaming
Quietly I keep you close to me
Quietly I feel you when I'm dreaming
Quietly I keep you close to me
Quietly I feel you when I'm dreaming
Follow the feeling, but patiently waiting
I lose my feelings to oblivion

The days to come
Feel it, the days, I feel it,
Quietly I keep you close to me
Quietly I feel you when I'm dreaming
Quietly I keep you close to me
Quietly I feel you when I'm dreaming
Follow the feeling, but patiently waiting
I lose my feelings to oblivion.

===================


I didn't want to think
Cause I knew I was out of my mind
You pulled me from the brink
And brought me to the other side

And I
Think we're there
And I
Think we're there

So goodnight goodnight
Don't have to have it all figured out
We'll be alright
What comes about is gonna come about
Tomorrow when we meet
You'll take me to a place I've never been
Find me in the sweetest oblivion

We have it all
In front of us
And I can see the
Sun is up to cover us
And I'm lifted up
Take me to a beautiful day
And I feel like my
Shadow is falling away
Falling away [x5]

And I don't wanna go
I wanna be here all night
No one has to know
No one has to say it's alright

'Cause I
Think we're there
And I
Think we're there

So goodnight goodnight
Don't have to have it all figured out
We'll be alright
What comes about is gonna come about
Tomorrow when we meet
You'll take me to a place I've never been
Find me in the sweetest oblivion

We have it all
In front of us
And I can see the
Sun is up to cover us
And I'm lifted up
You take me to a beautiful day
And I feel like my
Shadow is falling away
Falling away [x6]

===================


In the darkness
All I see is you
You
When I'm lost
You lead me home
It's true
Oh

So don't stop now
I'm falling for you, I can't lie
I wanted you to stay
'Cause it's hard to run away

So don't stop now
I'm falling for you, I can't lie
I wanted you to stay
'Cause it's hard to run away
It's hard to run away

Oh, feels like we're falling for the first time
Oh, this is exactly what it feels like
When I can't go to sleep unless you're laying next to me
Oh, feels like we're falling for the first time

Feels like we're falling for the first time
Feels like we're falling for the first time

I, I knew that you were worth it
I, don't know if I deserve this
You, have given me a purpose
You, yeah you were always worth it
I, I know that you're worth it
I, don't know if I deserve this
You, have given me a purpose
You, yeah you were always worth it

So don't stop now
I'm falling for you, I can't lie
I wanted you to stay
'Cause it's hard to run away

So don't stop now
I'm falling for you, I can't lie
I wanted you to stay
'Cause it's hard to run away
It's hard to run away

Oh, feels like I'm falling for the first time
Oh, this is exactly what it feels like
When I can't go to sleep unless you're laying next to me
Feels like we're falling for the first time

Oh, feels like I'm falling for the first time
Oh, this is exactly what it feels like
When I can't go to sleep unless you're laying next to me
Feels like we're falling for the first time

When I can't go to sleep unless you're laying next to me
Feels like we're falling for the first time

Feels like we're falling for the first time
Feels like we're falling for the first time

===================


Wrap your head around this make believe
You inspire as we grow older
Redesign as far as the eye can see
Let's get higher love before it's over

Light me up tonight
I will lay down my weapons in the fire
For higher love, higher love, higher love
We can both decide
How to lay all our differences aside
For higher love, higher love, higher love

On and on and on, we're awake in our colors
On and on and on, we don't fade for each other
On and on and on, we're awake in our colors

Light me up
Light me up

On and on and on, we're awake in our colors
On and on and on, we don't fade for each other
On and on and on, we're awake in our colors

Light me up tonight
I will lay down my weapons in the fire
For higher love, higher love, higher love
We can both decide
How to lay all our differences aside
For higher love, higher love, higher love
Higher love, higher love
Higher love, higher love

===================


Heart, don't fail me now
Even though the light is fading
When the world is burning down
Falling apart, falling apart as I'm breaking
So wake me now from these clouds
Storm in my head, you were like a ray of gold
In a night so cold, I need you again

So I, I close my eyelids, shut out the violence
Here in the silence, you're my horizon
When I am falling, I see you rising
Here in the silence, you're my horizon
You're my horizon, you're my horizon
You're my horizon

I close my eyelids, shut out the violence
Here in the silence, you're my horizon
When I am falling, I see you rising
Here in the silence, you're my horizon
You're my horizon, you're my horizon
You're my horizon

Oh, you're my horizon, horizon

===================


I've been trying to roll like a stone into your island (Oh, oh)
But everywhere I go, only echoes in the silence (Oh, oh)
You don't even know, you don't even show your diamonds (Oh, oh)
Where the fuck are you? Always leave me in the blindness

But I know it's not over
Feel the static, I can feel you getting closer
Send a flare to light the way
Oh, oh (Oh, mmm)
Oh, oh (Oh, yeah, yeah)

Holding out for you is like a drop into the ocean (Oh, oh)
Lost between the waves, treading water, but I'm open (Oh, oh)
That you might come around, fix the poison now, let's forget (Oh, oh)
Shadows in the dark, need your light to break 'em open

But I know it's not over
Feel the static, I can feel you getting closer
Send a flare to light the way
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Way onto your island

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Way onto your island
(Your island)

I've been trying to roll like a stone into your island (Oh, oh)
But everywhere I go, only echoes in the silence (Oh, oh)
You don't even know, you don't even show your diamonds (Oh, oh)
Where the fuck are you? Always leave me in the blindness

But I know it's not over
Feel the static, I can feel you getting closer
Send a flare to light the way
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Way onto your island

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

===================


Here I'll stay, waiting for the tide to turn
And sail away, all these breaking waves of hurt
I'll try to leave behind this savage world
Maybe someday I'll return
Patiently, you wait for me on the shore
Thinking time is all I need to give you more
But guarantees, I can't give you no
'Cause I'm a shipwreck sinking slowly

And promises they break
And I'm through making mistakes
Well, love's done nothing but cut me up
And carry me away

So now I hide my heart
It's buried somewhere deep at the bottom of the ocean
'Cause I've been torn apart
And what I thought was love nearly left me broken
So now I hide my heart
Far beneath the waves at the bottom of the ocean
If only I could get to you
What's swimming beneath the blue of this ocean

And promises they break
And I'm through making mistakes
Well, love's done nothing but cut me up
And carry me away

So now I hide my heart
It's buried somewhere deep at the bottom of the ocean
'Cause I've been torn apart
And what I thought was love nearly left me broken
So now I hide my heart
Far beneath the waves at the bottom of the ocean
If only I could get to you
What's swimming beneath the blue of this ocean

At the bottom of this ocean

===================


Your finger tips, on my skin
There's nothing that, I wouldn't give
To keep this love alive
We gave it all, we give it up
The chemistry, was not enough

Oh we just collide
I hate myself when I say:
"I need tonight just say goodbye
I will give what's left, inside"

So rush over me one more time
I will miss you, torn apart after tonight
And we can't fix it
Rush over me one more time
The end is coming
Rush over, rush over me
'Cause I will miss you
'Cause I will miss you

Hold on to me now, before we lose this
I keep breaking down, can I do this?
I need tonight to say goodbye, to say goodbye
To say goodbye...
To say goodbye...
To say goodbye

To say goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
  
===================


I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard

I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted

I had time to think it all over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath then jump then fall into me
Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa, oh, I need you baby
Don't be afraid, please,
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall, baby,
Jump then fall into me, into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine
And every time you're here
Baby I'll show you, I'll show you
You can Jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah

===================


Untouchable like a distant diamond sky,
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you,
I'm caught up in you

Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

It's half full, and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on

Oh, in the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

I'm caught up in you. Oh, oh.

But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh, oh

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, come on

In the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on

Like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
Spelling out your name

===================


Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened, please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're half way out the door

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it baby
I don't think so, oh oh oh
Back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything?

Back up, baby back up
Please back up, oh back up
Back up, baby back up

Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When we said forever and always
Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it baby
You said forever and always, yeah

===================


I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna' go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna' go there anymore

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna' have to go that far
And I, I've got you down
I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Oh, just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I've watched you so long
Screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say

But I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna' go there anymore…

===================


This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Morning loneliness, comes around when I'm not
Dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face, I'd be
Counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar, superstar

===================


In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough."
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up

'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread

So babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see
When I left I wanted you to chase after me

Yeah, I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, "There's nothing you can say to make this right again.
I mean it, I mean it."
What I mean is...

I said, "Leave," but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carry me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you

===================


There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Oh yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So, baby, drive slow
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss,
It's flawless,
Really something,
It's fearless.

Oh yeah

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Oh-oh
Oh yeah

===================


You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say,
"You know I haven't seen you around before."

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your mamma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
When you're fifteen
And your first kiss makes your head spin round
But in your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors.

===================


We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
I'm standing there 
On a balcony in summer air.

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns,
See you make your way through the crowd,
And say, "Hello."
Little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go."
And I said,

"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting. All that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."

So, I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew.
So, close your eyes,
Escape this town for a little while.
Oh, oh.

'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter.
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
But you were everything to me.
I was begging you, "Please don't go!"
And I said,

"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting. All that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.

Romeo, save me. They're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult but it's real.
Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."

Oh, oh, oh.

But I got tired of waiting,
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading,
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said,

"Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting for you, but you never come.
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think."
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said,

"Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.

===================


Hey, Stephen,
I know looks can be deceiving,
But I know I saw a light in you.
And as we walked
We were talking.
I didn't say half the things I wanted to.

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold.
Hey, Stephen,
Boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone.

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel,
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So, come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
I can't help myself.

Hey, Stephen,
I've been holding back this feeling.
So, I got some things to say to you, ha.
I seen it all—
So I thought—
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do.

The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name—
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change.
Hey, Stephen,
Why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same.

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel,
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So, come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
I can't help myself.

They're dimming the street lights.
You're perfect for me. Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so, come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine.

Hey, Stephen,
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose.
All those other girls—
Well, they're beautiful,
But would they write a song for you?

I can't help it if you look like an angel,
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So, come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
I can't help myself...

...if you look like an angel.
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So, come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
I can't help myself.

Myself.
Can't help myself.
I can't help myself.

===================


Say you're sorry
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl
I should have known, I should have known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

Maybe I was naïve
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh, it's too late
To catch me now

===================


You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset, she's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
And she'll never know your story like I do.

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you.
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,
"Hey, isn't this easy?"

And you've got a smile
That could light up this whole town.
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down.

You say you're fine I know you better than that.
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels,
I wear sneakers.
She's cheer captain,
And I'm on the bleachers.
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you,
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me.

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

[Instrumental]

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night.
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry.
I know your favorite songs,
And you tell me about your dreams.
Think I know where you belong,
Think I know it's with me.

Can't you see
That I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me.

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.

You belong with me.

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me.

===================


I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.
People are people, and sometimes we change our minds.
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time.

Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie.
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see.
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down.
Now I don't know what to be without you around.

And we know it's never simple, never easy,
Never a clean break. No one here to save me.
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand.

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve.
People are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out.
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fallout.

And we know it's never simple, never easy,
Never a clean break. No one here to save me.
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand.

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

It's two AM.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me.
It's two AM.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me.

And we know it's never simple, never easy,
Never a clean break. No one here to save me.

I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

Breathe without you
But I have to.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry

===================


I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why…

Why…do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why…do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why
Why, tell me why

I take a step back, let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know

===================


All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry... no, no, no, no

You are looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry... no, no, no

You're not sorry... no, no, no

You had me crawling for you honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry... no, no, no

You're not sorry... no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

===================


He is sensible and so incredible 
And all my single friends are jealous 
He says everything I need to hear and it's like 
I couldn't ask for anything better 
He opens up my door and I get into his car 
And he says you look beautiful tonight 
And I feel perfectly fine 

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
You're so in love that you act insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breakin' down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you 

He respects my space 
And never makes me wait 
And he calls exactly when he says he will 
He's close to my mother 
Talks business with my father 
He's charming and endearing 
And I'm comfortable 

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
You're so in love that you act insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breakin' down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you 

He can't see the smile I'm faking 
And my heart's not breaking 
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all 
And you were wild and crazy 
Just so frustrating intoxicating 
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now 

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain 
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name 
I'm so in love that I acted insane 
And that's the way I loved you 
Breaking down and coming undone 
It's a roller coaster kinda rush 
And I never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh 

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh 
Never knew I could feel that much 
And that's the way I loved you

===================


Once upon a time,
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night,
You looked me in the eye
And told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened, please tell me?
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're half way out the door

And I stare at the phone,
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure

So here's to everything
Coming down to nothing
Here's to silence
That cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone,
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low, you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it, baby,
I don't think so

Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Oh, I stare at the phone,
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always

And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it, baby,
You said forever and always... yeah

===================


I'm five years old
It's getting cold
I've got my big coat on

I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run

Past the pumpkin patch
And the tractor rides
Look now -- the sky is gold

I hug your legs
And fall asleep
On the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how
My friends could be so mean

I come home crying
And you hold me tight
And grab the keys

And we drive and drive
Until we've found a town
Far enough away

And we talk
And window-shop
'Til I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out he's better than I am

I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me

It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong

And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine

And I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day
With you today

===================


And it's a sad picture
The final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again
And you know it's all the same
Another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it

But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

So we've been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But we're faster and never scared

You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
This revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah

===================


You were in college working part time waiting tables,
Left a small town, never looked back.
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin'
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts.

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it.
Yes, yes, I can see it now.

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time.
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter.
You are the best thing that's ever been mine.

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together,
And there's a drawer of my things at your place.
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded,
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes.

But we got bills to pay,
We got nothing figured out,
When it was hard to take,
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about.

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time.
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter.
You are the best thing that's ever been mine.

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time.
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter.
You are the best thing that's ever been mine.

And I remember that fight,
Two-thirty AM,
As everything was slipping right out of our hands.
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street.
Braced myself for the "Goodbye"
'Cause that's all I've ever known.
Then you took me by surprise.
You said, "I'll never leave you alone."

You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water.
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time.
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter.
She is the best thing that's ever been mine."

Hold on, make it last.
Hold on, never turn back.

(Hold on)
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
(Hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine.

(Hold on)
Do you believe it?
(Hold on)
We're gonna make it now.
(Hold on)
And I can see it,
(Yes, yes)
I can see it now (see it now, see it now)

===================


The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something,
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be.
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would...

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild.
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right.
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.

Drop everything now,
Meet me in the pouring rain,
Kiss me on the sidewalk,
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile.
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

And the sparks fly...
Oh, baby, smile...
And the sparks fly...

===================


I'm so glad you made time to see me.
How's life? Tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while.

You've been good, busier than ever.
We small-talk, work and the weather.
Your guard is up and I know why.

Because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind.
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night,"
And I go back to December all the time.

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I go back to December all the time.

These days I haven't been sleeping,
Staying up, playing back myself leavin'.
When your birthday passed and I didn't call.

And I think about summer, all the beautiful times,
I watched you laughing from the passenger side.
And realized I loved you in the fall.

And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was "Goodbye".

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
And I go back to December all the time.

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind.
I go back to December all the time.

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile.
So good to me, so right.
And how you held me in your arms that September night:
The first time you ever saw me cry.

Maybe this is wishful thinking,
Probably mindless dreaming,
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right.

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't.
So if the chain is on your door I understand.

But this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
And I go back to December.

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind

I go back to December all the time.
All the time.

===================


I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus:]
Don’t say "Yes", run away now
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door
Don’t wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now."

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me,
You wish it was me,
Don’t you?

[Chorus:]
Don’t say "Yes", run away now,
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door.
Don’t wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now."
Don’t say "Yes", run away now,
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door.
Don’t wait or say a single vow,
Your time is running out,
And they said, "Speak now."

Oh, la, la
Oh, oh
Say a single vow

I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace."
There’s the silence, there’s my last chance.
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me.
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I’m only looking at you.

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

[Chorus:]
So, don’t say "Yes", run away now,
I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door.
Don’t wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,
And they said, "Speak now."
And you say, "Let’s run away now,
I’ll meet you when I’m out of my tux at the back door.
Baby, I didn’t say my vows,
So glad you were around
When they said, "Speak now."

===================


Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through
Again

And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules every day

Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone tonight.
Well, I stopped pickin' up, and this song is to let you know why.

Dear John,
I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home.
I should've known.

Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism
To blame.
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love then take it away.

And you'll add my name
To your long list of traitors
Who don't understand.
And I look back in regret.
How I ignored when they said,
"Run as fast as you can."

Dear John,
I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home.

Dear John,
I see it all now. It was wrong.
Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played
By your dark twisted games?
When I loved you so.
I should've known.

You are an expert at "Sorry"
And keeping lines blurry.
Never impressed by me acing your tests.
All the girls that you've run dry
Have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you've burned them out.

But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me.
So, don't look now.
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town.

Dear John,
I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home.

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With?
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song.
You should've known.

You should've known.
Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known.

===================


You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

Well you can take me down with just one single blow
But you don't know, what you don't know...

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down
Trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know, what you don't know...

Someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean

All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so?...

Someday I'll be living in a big old city (Why you gotta be so?...)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean (Why you gotta be so?...)
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me (Why you gotta be so?...)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

===================


I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,
How we met and the sparks flew instantly,
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones."
I used to know my place was the spot next to you.
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat,
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on.

Oh, a simple complication,
Miscommunications lead to fall-out.
So many things that I wish you knew.
So many walls up I can't break through.

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking.
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

Next chapter.

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy,
And you're doing your best to avoid me.
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us,
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here,
But you held your pride like you should've held me.

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending,
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how.
I've never heard silence quite this loud.

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking.
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less,
But I liked it better when you were on my side.

The battle's in your hands now,
But I would lay my armour down
If you said you'd rather love than fight.

So many things that you wish I knew,
But the story of us might be ending soon.

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking.
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
But I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now.

...and we're not speaking.
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down,
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

The end.

===================


Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At 14 there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up

===================


There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired lonely place

Walls of insincerity,
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey,
It was enchanting to meet you,
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you."

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

===================


"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did."

Time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and...
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress
She's better known
For the things that she does on the mattress

Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress
She's better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress

Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but I always get the last word

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress
(she deserve it)
She's better known
For the things that she does on the mattress

Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do.
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do
I don't think you do

Let's hear the applause
Come on show me how much better you are
(so much better, yeah?)
So you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better

She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"

===================


I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tightrope
It's never too late to get it back

===================


You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all so quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I know, I know, I just know
You're not gone. You can't be gone. No

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it...

===================


I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last...

===================


I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild

We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew
Our lives would never be the same

You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now

We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd!"
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves
In ripped-up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Will you take a moment,
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in

And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name

Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

===================


Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now my time is theirs

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine

And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate
If it's wrong and
Your hands are tough
But they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours

The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

===================


Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me,
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you,
Not before I knew how much I had to lose."

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

If you're out there,
If you're somewhere,
If you're moving on,
I've been waiting for you.
Ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before.
And I just wanna see you back at my front door.
And I'd say

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said, "It's not that easy."
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now, whoa
Thought you'd be here by now

===================


Tall, dark and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say

And you smile and say, "How are you?"
I'll say, "Just fine."
I always forget to tell you, I love you, I'll love you forever

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say

And you'll leave, got places to be
And I'll be OK
I always forget to tell you I love you, I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

'Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

When you come back down

===================


I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know
Is touch and go

We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know
Is don't let go

We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs
Four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never
(So you were never a saint
I've loved in shades of wrong)
Be the same
(We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild)

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

===================


[Verse 1:]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

[Chorus:]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2:]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

[Chorus:]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

[Bridge:]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

[Chorus:]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

[Post-Chorus:]
And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah

His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

===================


Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you a—get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I... I, I, I... I, I, I...

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, I'll get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

===================


[Music video spoken part:]
I think - I think when it's all over,
It just comes back in flashes, you know?
It's like a kaleidoscope of memories.
It just all comes back. But he never does.
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.
It's not really anything he said or anything he did,
It was the feeling that came along with it.
And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again.
But I don't know if I should.
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.
But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
Maybe he knew that when he saw me.
I guess I just lost my balance.
I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him.
It was losing me.

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies. He'll never see you cry,
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Music video spoken part:]
I don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are.

===================


I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost Upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone
And that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay
But I'm not fine at all

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed
And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well

Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

===================


It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh.
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh.

Yeah,
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical.
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time

Uh oh!
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It seems like one of those nights,
This place is too crowded.
Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's Taylor Swift anyway, ew?)
It seems like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping.

Yeah,
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical.
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time

Uh oh! (hey!)
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright (alright)
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh (oh, oh, oh)
22, ooh-ooh
I don't know about you
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It feels like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene.
It feels like one of those nights,
We won't be sleeping.
It feels like one of those nights,
You look like bad news.
I gotta have you,
I gotta have you.

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey
I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me (you don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

It feels like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights,
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights,
You look like bad news,
I gotta have you,
I gotta have you.

===================


I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply.
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say "Hello" to you
And risk another goodbye.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe.
It's probably better off this way.
And I confess, babe,
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you.
And I almost do.

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do,
I almost do.

I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me.

===================


I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space. (What?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me."
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you."

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together,
We are never ever ever getting back together,
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like, ever...

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Oh oh oh

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say, "Never say never..."
Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you,"
And I'm like... "I just... I mean this is exhausting, you know, like,
We are never getting back together. Like, ever"

No!

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, ooh, getting back together, ohhh,
We, ooh, getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

===================


I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night.
I threw my phone across the room at you.
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away,
But you stayed.

This morning I said we should talk about it.
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved.
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, "Okay, let's talk."

And I said,
Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay.

Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers,
Who took all of their problems out on me.
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'.
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to...

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay.

You took the time to memorize me:
My fears, my hopes, and dreams.
I just like hangin' out with you all the time.
All those times that you didn't leave;
It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life.

Stay.
And I'll be loving you for quite some time.
No one else is gonna love me, when I get mad, mad, mad.
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay.

[Background:] That's so fun!

===================


[Gary Lightbody:]
I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I'm not sure how I got there
All roads—they lead me here

I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

[Both:]
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

[Taylor Swift:]
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave

And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

[Both:]
And right before your eyes
I'm aching, no past
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

[Taylor Swift:] This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
[Gary Lightbody:] This is the last time I say it's been you all along
[Taylor Swift:] This is the last time I let you in my door
[Gary Lightbody:] This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore

Oh, oh, oh

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

This is the last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this

===================


I was reminiscing just the other day,
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away.
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time.
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.
Took off faster than a green light "Go".
Yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know.
I left a note on the door with a joke we’d made,
And that was the first day.

And darling, it was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress,
We had this big wide city all to ourselves.
We blocked the noise with the sound of ‘I need you’,
And for the first time I had something to lose,
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way.
And the story’s got dust on every page,
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now.
And I see your face in every crowd.

Cause darling, it was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through.
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you.
Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in this room.
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you,

It was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through.
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you.
Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in this room.
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you.

===================


Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

In dreams I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and, darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up and for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful

And we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

===================


New to town with a made up name in the angel's city,
Chasing fortune and fame.
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream.

You had it figured out since you were in school.
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool.
So overnight you look like a sixties’ queen.

Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky.

And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh...

Now it’s big black cars, and Riviera views,
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page.

And they tell you that you’re lucky.
But you’re so confused,
'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used.
And all the young things line up to take your place.

Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if you’ll make it out alive.

And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

It was a few years later, I showed up here.
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,
And it took some time, but I understand it now.

‘Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right,

Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

Yeah they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, whoa, oh, oh

[Taylor Swift:]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel like

I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now

[Both:]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Ed Sheeran:]
And all my walls stood tall painted blue
And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you

[Taylor Swift (Album version) / Ed Sheeran (Remix version):]
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
[Album version:] Taking flight, making me feel right
[Remix version:] Taking flight, making me feel right like

[Both:]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Both:]
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Bridge:]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

[Taylor Swift:]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Both:]
All I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Taylor Swift:]
All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain and everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

===================


I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up late one night out the window,
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you: worrying too much about things you can't change.
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way."
He was tryna skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me,
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancing with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?

===================


Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl
Who had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies that your family
Watches
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that
And for the first time what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months

Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

===================


You should've been there,
Should've burst through the door,
With that 'baby I'm right here' smile,
And it would've felt like,
A million little shining stars had just aligned,
And I would've been so happy.

Christmas lights glisten,
I've got my eye on the door,
Just waiting for you to walk in,
But the time is ticking,
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory,
How you said you'd be here,
You said you'd be here.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
As I'm looking around the room,
But there's one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

And the hours pass by,
Now I just wanna be alone,
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong,
So they follow me down the hall,
And there in the bathroom,
I try not to fall apart,
And the sinking feeling starts,
As I say hopelessly,
"He said he'd be here."

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
And asking me about you,
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do when the one
Who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here.
And I would've been so happy.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no one to impress,
And they're all standing around me singing
"Happy birthday to you",
But there was one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

Ooh, I knew.
Ooh,

You called me later,
And said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it,"
And I said, "I'm sorry too,"
And that was the moment I knew.

===================


You said it in a simple way,
4 AM, the second day,
How strange that I don't know you at all.
Stumbled through the long goodbye,
One last kiss, then catch your flight,
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, "Don't get attached,"
But in my mind I play it back,
Spinning faster than the plane that took you...

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

The delicate beginning rush,
The feeling you can know so much,
Without knowing anything at all.
And now that I can't put this down,
If I had known what I'd known now,
I never would have played so nonchalant.

Taxi cabs and busy streets,
That never bring you back to me,
I can't help but wish you took me with you...

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in London today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

This is falling in love in the cruelest way,
This is falling for you when you are worlds away.

New York... be here.
But you're in London and I break down,
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.

This is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
And I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

I don't wanna miss you like this.
Come back... be here.
Come back... be here.

===================


Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that.

I don't even know her,
But I feel a responsibility,
To do what's upstanding and right,
It's kinda like a code, yeah,
And you've been getting closer and closer,
And crossing so many lines.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
But honey I am no-one's exception,
This I have previously learned.

So don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
I see you turn off your phone,
And now you got me alone,
And I say,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

I just wanna make sure,
You understand perfectly,
You're the kind of man who makes me sad,
While she waits up,
You chase down the newest thing,
And take for granted what you have.

And it would be a fine proposition,
If I was a stupid girl,
And yeah I might go with it,
If I hadn't once been just like her.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
I see you turn off your phone,
And now you've got me alone,
And I say,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

Call a cab,
Lose my number,
You're about to lose your girl,
Call a cab,
Lose my number,
Let's consider this lesson learned.

Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Wanna see you pick up your phone,
And tell her you're coming home,
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that,
Uh, uh
Don't look at me,
You've got a girl at home,
And everybody knows that,
Everybody knows that.

It would be a fine proposition,
If I hadn't once been just like her.

===================


Walking through a crowd
The village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud
Heartbeats under coats
Everybody here
Wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't
Heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on
Apartment floors
Took our broken hearts
Put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else
Before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and
Girls and girls

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Like any great love it keeps you
Guessing
Like any real love
It's ever changing
Like any true love

It drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't
Change anything anything
Anything

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me
Welcome to New York
New soundtrack
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright
They never blind me
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

===================


Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

===================


Midnight,
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive,
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style.

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah.
I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl."

He says, "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you," and I...
I said, "I've been there, too, a few times."

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home, yeah.
Just take me home
(out of style)

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

===================


Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking…

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods?

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinkin'

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods?

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started cryin', baby, I did, too
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said, "I'm settin' you free"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
And when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me

You were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me
I remember, oh, I remember

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

===================


People like you always want back the love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Stay
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Stay
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Let me remind you
This was what you wanted
You ended it
You were all I wanted
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this

Oh, all you had to do was...

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Stay
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Stay
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
(All you had to do was stay)
Well, it could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

===================


I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

I go on too many dates [chuckle]
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm

I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world,
You could've been getting down to this sick beat.

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like "Oh, my god!" but I'm just gonna shake.
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake

Yeah ohhh

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (mmmm)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (and fake, and fake, and fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you've got to),
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

===================


It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back,
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
And I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

It's 2 AM in my room.
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you.
We're a crooked love in a straight line down.
Makes you wanna run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back,
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for.
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish.

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish...

2 AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I wish you would come back,
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
And I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for.
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish you would

===================


'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Did you have to do this? I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
Now did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't, so if you're coming my way, just don't

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey)
You say sorry just for show (hey)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey)
Mhmmm
If you love like that blood runs cold

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love (mad love)
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them)
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
(Hey)

He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-ha oh
Wildest dreams, ah-ha oh

I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-ha oh
Wildest dreams, ah-ha oh

You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah-ha oh
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha oh
(Even if it's just in your wildest dreams) ah-ha
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha

===================


Oh oh oh.
Oh-oh.

Stand there like a ghost shaking from the rain (rain).
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane ('ane)?"
Say it's been a long 6 months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want (want)

And that's how it works.
That's how you get the girl.
And then you say,

"I want you for worse or for better,
I would wait forever and ever,
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together.
I would wait forever and ever."

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl...
Oh.

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl...

Remind her how it used to be, be (yeah, yeah)
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks (cheeks)
Tell her how you must have lost your mind. (uh-uh)
When you left her all alone, and never told her why (why).

And that's how it works.
That's how you lost the girl.
And now you say,

"I want you for worse or for better,
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever),
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together (together).
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever)."

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl...
Oh.

And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl... (Yeah, yeah)

And you could know (oh-oh oh oh)
That I don't want you to go oh-oh..

Remind me how it used to be.
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks.
And say you want me.
Yeah...

And then you say,

"I want you for worse or for better (for worse or for better),
I would wait forever and ever,
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together.
I want you forever and ever."

[4x]
And that's how it works
It's how you get the girl, girl.
Oh.

That's how it works.
That's how you got the girl.

===================


Clear blue water, high tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker, currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams,
In wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

Tossing, turning, struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern burning, flickered in my mind for only you
But you're still gone, gone, gone

Been losing grip,
On sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love, this love, this love, this love... [4x]

Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
When you're young you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love... [in background 'til the end]

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love, this love, this love, this love... [4x]

This love came back to me

===================


(I, I, I, I I, I, I, I I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I)

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, but we're bulletproof
I know places
And you know for me, it's always you
I know places
In the dead of night, your eyes so green
I know places
And I know for you, it's always me
I know places

(I, I, I, I I, I, I, I I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I)

===================


The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war
and the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you,
I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs
I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you,
I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean
Said I think I am finally clean

10 months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
10 months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you,
I think I am finally clean

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
Think I'm finally clean

===================


Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole.

You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
I'm spinning out of control.

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?

Oh

Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night.

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed.

But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams.

Oh

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?

Oh

Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind.

But darling, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland
Eh [5x]
In wonderland

I reached for you but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You search the world for something else to make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad.

Oh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (last forever)
Eh eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better (never better)
Eh eh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever (in wonderland)

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
And life was never worse but never better
In wonderland

===================


One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast
You play it back
Buttons on a coat
Lighthearted joke
No proof, not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says, "Look up."
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
But you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence)
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home)
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much
But it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight then you talk
One night he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says.
"You're my best friend."
And you knew what it was
He is in love

You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence)
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home)
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love

And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence)
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home)
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence)
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home)
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

[Music video version:]
"The fans are the best part of this tour
They are the reason the shows are incredible
And I know those fans out there, are just all in"

We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace

We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic

[Music video version:]
"I don't want to forget anything that happened on this tour
It was one of those remarkable moments in time when everything felt exciting"

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

"Looking out into like an endless ocean of crowd
That was everything
We're all really sad that it is ending
But we're all really happy because of what it was"

Knew he was a killer
First time that I saw him
Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom
Some, some boys are tryin' too hard
He don't try at all though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I-I-I see how this is gonna go
Touch me, and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
(Are you ready for it?)

Knew I was a robber
First time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
But if I'm a thief then
He can join the heist
And we'll move to an island-and
And he can be my jailer
Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now
I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I-I-I see how this is gonna go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
(No one has to know)

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
(Are you ready for it?)
(Ooh, are you ready for it?)

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

I-I-I see how this is gonna go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
In the middle of the night

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
(Are you ready for it?)
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
(Are you ready for it?)

I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
Ah, and you heard about me
Ooh, I got some big enemies (yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation
Ah, and I heard about you (yeah)
Ooh, you like the bad ones, too

[Future:]
You so dope, don't overdose
I'm so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat
I got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me (yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (yeah)
I'm in a G5 (yeah), come to the A-Side (yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (what they like)
You love it, I love it, too, 'cause you my type (you my type)
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

[Taylor Swift & Future:]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

[Taylor Swift:]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Ed Sheeran:]
Knew her when I was young
Reconnected when we were little bit older, both sprung
I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me; in rumors I’m knee-deep
The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in a song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[Taylor Swift:]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah, but I ain't tryna play

[Taylor Swift:]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Taylor Swift & Future:]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations
Ah, and you heard about me
Oh, I got some big enemies
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation
Ah, and I heard about you
Ooh, you like the bad ones, too

[Taylor Swift:]
I hit you like bang
We tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Taylor Swift, Future & Ed Sheeran:]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look—oh—so easy

'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson-red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit
Then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit
'Cause he had it coming

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me

They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, "Don't throw away a good thing."
But if he drops my name
Then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change
Then he had it comin'

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

It just felt so good

They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons

They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up)

Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), light me up

They say I did something bad (oh)
Then why's it feel so good? (so good)
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had (most fun I ever had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good (good), good

Oh, you say I did something bad
(You say I did something bad?)
Why's it feel so good, good?
So bad, why's it feel so good?
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (bad)
It just felt so good, good

Don't blame me.
Love made me crazy.
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right.
Lord, save me.
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life.

I've been breaking hearts a long time
And toying with them older guys.
Just playthings for me to use.
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise.
Shaking, pacing, I just need you.

For you,
I would cross the line,
I would waste my time,
I would lose my mind.
They say, "She's gone too far this time."

Don't blame me.
Love made me crazy.
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right.
Lord, save me.
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life.

Don't blame me.
Love made me crazy.
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right.
Oh, Lord, save me.
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life.

My name is whatever you decide,
And I'm just gonna call you mine.
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby).
Echoes (echoes) of your name inside my mind.
Halo, hiding my obsession.
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy.

And, baby, for you,
I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face.
If you walk away,
I'd beg you on my knees to stay.

Don't blame me.
Love made me crazy.
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right.
Lord, save me.
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life.

Don't blame me.
Love made me crazy.
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right.
Oh, Lord, save me.
My drug is my baby.
I'll be using for the rest of my life.

I get so high, oh,
Every time you're—every time you're loving me
You're loving me.
Trip of my life, oh,
Every time you're—every time you're touching me.
You're touching me.

Every time you're—every time you're loving me.

Oh, Lord, save me.
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life.
(Using for the rest of my life. Oh!)

Don't blame me.

If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (doing it right, no).
Lord, save me.
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life.

Love made me crazy.
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (you ain't doing it...).
Oh, Lord, save me.
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life (I'll be using, I'll be using).

I get so high, oh,
Every time you're—every time you're loving me.
You're loving me.
Oh, Lord, save me.
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life.

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink...

Dive bar on the east side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink...

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Delicate

Third floor on the west side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Delicate

Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Yeah, I want you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
'Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that?
(Isn't it?)
Is it chill that you're in my head?
(Isn't it? Isn't it?)
'Cause I know that it's delicate

Yeah, I want you

===================


I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh!)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

(Ooh, look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you just made me do)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now."
(Look what you just made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
"Why?"
(Look what you just made me do)
"Oh, 'cause she's dead!" (Oh!)

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ooh, look what you made me do

===================


See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip, trippin' when you're gone

'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it...

And all the pieces fall
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes...
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes...

Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your grey days clear and
Wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip, skippin' when I'm gone

'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it...

And all the pieces fall
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes...
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes...

Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes...
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes...

You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
I did a number on you
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
Who's counting?
1, 2, 3

And all the pieces fall (pieces fall)
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment (caught up, caught up)
Lipstick on your face
So it goes...
I'm yours to keep (oh)
And I'm yours to lose (baby)
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes...

Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes...
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes...
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes...
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes...

Gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doing, I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)

Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life, by not being mine

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (dark room, dark room)
If you got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
(Honey, it hurts)

Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats
Alone, unless you wanna come along, oh...

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You're gorgeous

No, nothing good starts in a getaway car...

It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray and candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

X marks the spot, where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lying to myself
I knew it from the first old fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark

You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinking
And I was just drinking
Well he was running after us, I was screaming 'Go go go!'
But with three of us, honey, it's a side show
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)

X marks the spot, where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first old fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart

You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

We were jet set Bonnie and Clyde
Until I switched to the other side
It's no surprise, I turned you in
'Cause us traitors never win

I'm in a getaway car
I left you in the motel bar
I put the money in a bag and stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me

Driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

I was riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said 'goodbye' in a getaway car

I was riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said 'goodbye' in a getaway car

===================


I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off being alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on calling me, baby, like trying on clothes

Salute to me I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa

And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury

Salute to me I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa

And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa

And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

===================


I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, 25 years old
Oh, how were you to know and

My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know what

I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance
Oh, through an avalanche?
And say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me

I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
(Ooh, we had our hands tied)
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again

Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

Hands tied, hands tied

===================


Our secret moments
In a crowded room
They got no idea
About me and you
There is an indentation
In the shape of you
Made your mark on me
A golden tattoo
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah)
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this (ha, ha, ha, ha)

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)

Inescapable
I'm not even going to try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about

All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah)
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this (ah, ha, ha, ha)

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)...
Only bought this dress so you could take it off (ha, ha, ha)...
Only bought this dress so you could take it off (ha, ha, ha)...

Flashback when you met me
Your buzz cut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best of me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Aha, ha, ha, ha

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)

There is an indentation
In the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

===================


It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head
I'm locking the gates

This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

It was so nice being friends again
There I was giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately
If only you weren't
So shady

This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have

Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about that he said, she said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my momma
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

This is why we can't have nice things, darling (darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
(And here's to my baby)
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(He didn't care about that he said, she said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

===================


Ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh
Ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh

My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doing better than I ever was

Cause...
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover
Making forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

I want to wear his initial on a chain round my neck
Chain round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November, holding my breath
Slowly I said, "You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?"
Yes (would you run away?)

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want
To

===================


There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

===================


How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived in the shade you were throwing
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind

But then something happened one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show

But you showed who you are, then one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did
It isn't hate, it's just indifference
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
So, yeah

===================


(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinning like a devil

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

===================


We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my
Lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my
Lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be over-dramatic and true to my
Lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat
Lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my
Lover

===================


I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Oh)
I'd be the man (Yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)

If I was a man, then I'd be the man

===================


Combat
I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that
But what if I do?

'Cause cruelty
Wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown out speeches
I almost said to you

Easy they come
Easy they go
I jump from the train
I ride off alone
I never grew up
It's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?

Dark side
I search for your dark side
But what if I'm all right
Right, right, right here?

And I cut off
My nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection
For years and years

I wake in the night
I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire
Invisible smoke
And all of my heroes
Die all alone
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Screaming, "Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?"

(I see right through me, I see right through me)

'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

All the king's horses
All the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies
Started out friends
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?

(I see right through me, I see right through me)

Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay

Combat
I'm ready for combat

===================


I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine

He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
No one understands

He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, oh, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
I think he knows
He better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)

He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand
Boy, I understand

He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, oh, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul

Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We can follow the sparks, I'll drive
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We can follow the sparks, I'll drive
"So where we gonna go?"
I whisper in the dark
"Where we gonna go?"
I think he knows

He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue (Baby)
Got that, oh, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like (Yeah)
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul
I want you, bless my (Oh, baby)
I want you, bless my soul (He got my heartbeat)
I want you, bless my (Skipping down 16th Avenue, baby)
I want you, bless my soul
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows

===================


You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at sixteen, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)

No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)

No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I just thought you should know
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win)

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
Oh, I just thought you should know (You should know)
It's you and me, there's nothing like this (Like this)
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue (Paint it blue)
Voted most likely to run away with you

And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win), I just thought you should know

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
"She's a bad, bad girl"

===================


The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Ah

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh huh

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right, you're the one I want
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in all my dreams
You're the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in all my dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

You're the one I want, one I want
You're the one I want, one I want

===================


We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)

"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car

===================


My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not

It's death by a thousand cuts

My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united, we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be all right, it's just a thousand cuts

I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)

Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"

===================


We can go driving in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just round London
Alright, yeah

I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives

You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)

And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English

You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you

So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney, on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you (Oh)

You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking SoHo
Drinking in the afternoon (Yeah)
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you (You)
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah)
You know I love a London boy (Oh)
Boy (Oh), I fancy you (I fancy you, ooh)

So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
I, I, I fancy you
Oh whoa, oh, I
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney, on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Ooh)
Wanna be with you
I fancy you (Yeah), I fancy you
Oh whoa, ah

===================


The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...

Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you...

Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?

This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to

Ooh-ah
You'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

===================


We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd fly to you?

And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
I'm New York City, I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love

I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah

Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love

===================


You are somebody that I don't know
But you're taking shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, "Damn!
It's 7 AM"

Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey!
Are you OK?"

And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned the lesson
That stressing and obsessing
'Bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to just stop
Like, can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down"

You are somebody that we don't know
But you're coming at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad
When you could be GLAAD?
(You could be GLAAD)

Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Just making that sign
Must've taken all night

You just need to take several seats
And then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream
About all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to just stop
Like, can you just not step on his gown
You need to calm down"

And we see you over there on the Internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now
We all got crowns
You need to calm down

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to calm down
(You need to calm down)
You're being too loud
(You're being too loud)
And I'm just like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to just stop
(Can you stop?)
Like, can you just not step on our gowns
You need to calm down"

===================


I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn't do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no

Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh

I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, don't walk away, I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

===================


I promise that you'll never find another like me

I know that I'm a handful baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me-e-eh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never want to see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Living in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company-e-e-eh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

[Single version: 
Hey, kids
Spelling is fun]

Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
Strike the band up 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me

Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
And you can't spell "awesome" without "me"
I promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh

Yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(And I won't stop, baby)
I'm the only one of me
(I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me-e-e-eh
(Baby, that's the fun of me)

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
But you know there is a "me"
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me-e-e-eh

Strike the band up 1, 2, 3
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You can't spell "awesome" without "me"
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

===================


Ooh
Ooh

School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
"Wanna hang out?" Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents

It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

Light pink sky up on the roof
Sun sinks down, no curfew
20 questions, we tell the truth
You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand

It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

Church bells ring, carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff, call you "Babe"
Have my back, yeah, every day
Feels like home, stay in bed
The whole weekend

It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
(Ooh)

===================


My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (daylight), I only see daylight (daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be)

Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things that I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Not the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love

===================


Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know (no one has to know)

In the middle of the night, in my dreams (Night, in my dreams)
You should see the things we do, baby (We'd do, baby)
In the middle of the night in my dreams (My dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Night, in my dreams
We'd do, baby
Yeah, in the middle of the night
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby

===================


The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me

Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

wahooahoo

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive

The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see that
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me

===================


All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Outrun my gun

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Faster than my bullet

Ellen works a long day
Giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater
And it gets kinda weird
Yeah, calling us like we're boyfriend and girlfriend

But it's not cause we're just sitting here
And we got cat videos and dance on Betty White and stuff
And it's always gonna get weird
Cause this song is all about Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancing

I've been on this show
Eight times now and I still remember
Ellen hiding in the bathroom with a hidden camera
And she scared me so bad and I fell and I could've died

She's always asks me who I'm dating
Every time I'm on this show
And I don't even know why
But it gets five million hits on YouTube

Cause, Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancing

===================


I wake up, I stretch out
I wonder what you're doing right now
Yeah, I slept in my makeup again
Tell myself I must be crazy, 
Thinking about him

I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you I'd be

[Chorus]
A stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for her love to find her
Lonely like a harbor line
Thats never seen a boat
Just like a line in an old love letter
No one wrote

I go to work, work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say
Walk to my car, dig out my keys
Start thinking if you were with anyone but me

[Chorus]

There you are, on the street
Standing there all waiting on me
Yeah, I show you, my new shoes
You say you love em, and baby without you,
I'd be

[Chorus]

I wake up, I stretch out
Wonder what you're doing right now

===================


Sometimes I wonder how it's gonna feel
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call?
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
Everyday he says, darling you're my best girl
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

I know I'm not a little girl anymore
Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

It's a run around the world
And it's moving so fast
Though I wanna find
A love that's gonna last
A love so strong
That I can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of its hand

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game
Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars
Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for love

===================


American boy, living life as it goes
Sittin' on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive

[Chorus:]
The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
the hope of an american boy

Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an american beauty
suddenly he cheats, sent from above

[Chorus:]
The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
the dream of an american boy

American boy, raising little babies
hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
that's grown up, american boy

[Chorus:]
The simple things in life are always new
growing up on Grandview avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
the greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
the hope of an american boy

===================


Well, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else

After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
She had one little promise she was gonna keep

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing on the beach

And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Oh, take it easy now

Oh yeah, all right
She was an American girl

===================


Angelina’s got a pretty face
And really long brown hair
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
I’ve never been there
I guess some people come around and purpose she
But I don’t cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say
I wasn’t brought up that way

Just watched Stephen run across the field
Watched him catch the ball
He’s got everything you’d wanna be
He’s funny, dark and tall
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I won’t cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say
I wasn’t brought up that way

Stardom pushed across the line
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
But ain’t it funny how
It all comes out
Isn’t life sweet?

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not, I’m not oh
And I’m not perfect you could say
I wasn’t brought up that way

===================


I like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you mean,
Do you mean what you say?
When you say our love could last forever

Well, I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

I like the way you'd hold me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you'd sing to me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you say,
Do you say what you mean?
When you say our love could last forever

Well, I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

Oh, yeah, yeah

You'd run around
And lead me on forever
While I stay at home
Still thinking we're together
I want our love to last forever

But I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
And I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow
Now baby don't you break my heart
Slow

===================


Taking it slow, but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roamed
I turned him to gold and took him higher

Well, I'll be your daydream, I'll be your favorite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go

Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
Hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room
Hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Ah
Ah
Say you'll never let me go

Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
Hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room
Hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Say you'll never let me go
Ah
Say you'll never let me go
Ah

===================


To know what it's like to love somebody the way I love you
To know what it's like to love somebody the way I love you
To know how it feels to kill yourself with bad habits
To know what you want, know you'll never truly have it

New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight 

New York City, please go easy on me, tonight

When I went away, saw your face in my rear-view
I knew that look on your face, that I had lost you

New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight

You promised, I promised
I never knew I could be this selfish
Nights downtown, it's a new town
But I keep thinking I see your face in the crowd
But you're not here and you won't be
Cause you love me enough to let go of me

New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight

===================


Thought that I'd be better off
If I were on my own
I tried to put my finger
On the moment we were wrong

But the taste turned bitter
So I pulled the trigger
Not so easy to move on
I guess I should have known

Ice cold, I freeze up when I see ya
Left you just to find out that I need ya
So far, I wanna pull you closer
I wish we could start the whole thing over

Ever since I left you
I've been trying to get you back
And it keeps getting worse
I'm burning on the inside
And the truth is that I didn't know how good you were

Until you were gone
Until you were gone
Until you were gone
Until you were gone

I was always told that only time would heal the pain
And even though it's been so long, it still hurts just the same
Yeah you know I'm finding that the break was binding
I take back everything I said, ooh, won't you just come home?

Ice cold, I freeze up when I see ya
Left you just to find out that I need ya
So far, I wanna pull you closer
I wish we could start the whole thing over

Ever since I left you out
I've been trying to get you back
And it keeps getting worse
I'm burning on the inside
And the truth is that I didn't know how good you were

Until you were gone
Until you were gone
Until you were gone
Until you were gone

===================


Freely feeling everything
You had me reeling
All along the bottom of the deep sea
Can I shake this feeling?
Can I shake this feeling?

Tonight, light a fire
We'll be flying up and higher
Burning bright, taking flight
As we leave all our worries behind
It is something special you have
If you didn't know, but now just

Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed

Freely feeling everything
You had me reeling
Can I shake this feeling?

Tonight, light a fire
We'll be flying up and higher

Make your ass shake like a waterbed

Make your ass shake like a waterbed

Can I shake this feeling?

===================


I got something to say
A confession of me
I've been led astray
Tried so hard to change
But I'm set on my ways
My words mean nothing again

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

I promised I'd be good
I promised I'd be good

I just couldn't resist
It was the moment of bliss
I know it's hard to forgive
It's too late for changes
All this time I've wasted
Words mean nothing, nothing again

I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

I promised I'd be good
I promised I'd be good

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

===================


Down to my last match fire I'll touch just to feel
Why's it easier to burn than it is to heal?

Out in the cold you have been
I've begged you to come back in
But I can't do this again

I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

I've been looking for answers I don't want to hear
Chest to chest with you I'm staring into a mirror

Out in the cold you have been
I've begged you to come back in
But I can't do this again

I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

What would I do?
What I wouldn't do to save you
What would I do?
What I wouldn't do to save you

I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

I can't
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't
I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

===================


Fighting flames with fire
Hang on to burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colours
Maybe we should let this go

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go.
Blow the smoke right through the window."
'Cause this is all we know

'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go.
Blow the smoke right through the window."
'Cause this is all we know

'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

===================


Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue
But I'm OK
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them
Again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you,
I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson
OK

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

===================


Bend your chest open so I can reach your heart
I need to get inside, or I'll start a war
Wanna look at the pieces that make you who you are
I wanna build you up and pick you apart

Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out
Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out

I'm gonna love you in...
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you

I'm gonna pick your brain and get to know your thoughts
So I can read your mind when you don't wanna talk
And can I touch your face before you go
I collect your scales but you don't have to know

Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out
Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out

I'm gonna love you in...
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you

I'm gonna love you inside out
Your love, inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out
I'm gonna love you inside out
Inside out
Your love, inside out
I'm gonna love, I'm gonna love you inside out
Ou-ou-ou-out, ou-ou-ou-out
I'm gonna love you
Ou-ou-ou-out, ou-ou-ou-out
I'm gonna love you
Ou-ou-ou-out, ou-ou-ou-out
I'm gonna love you

===================


Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name but you're not around
I say your name but you're not around

I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-don't let me down

Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down

Running out of time
I really thought you were on my side
But now there's nobody by my side

I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-don't let me down

Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down

Oh, I think I'm losing my mind now, yeah
Oh, I think I'm losing my mind now, yeah

I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling, I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down

Yeah, don't let me down
Yeah, don't let me down
Don't let me down, oh, no
Said don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down

Don't let me down, down, down

===================


You know, I'm sorry
I won't make it to your party
Got caught up in my own selfishness
It won't let me be a part of this
And I know I've started
Drifting off every second
I can't wait to leave as soon as I arrive
I count the seconds

Down and down we go
We'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

I know it's pathetic
Fuck it, yeah, I said it
Tried to tell it like it is
There's a chance that I'll regret it, so
Let's go, let's end this
I delete before I send it
And we can play pretend
Like we haven't reached the end yet

Down and down we go
And we'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

(You know, I'm sorry)
(I'm sorry)
No, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
I cannot help it if I like the way she makes me feel it

"Give me time, give me space, give me reason."
That's what you tell me when you're leaving
Change your mind every night like the seasons
You're insatiable

And I know you say you want it now (want it now)
Give me the runaround (runaround)
Which one am I with now?
She's got seven personalities, every one's a tragedy

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
I cannot help it if I like the way she makes me feel it

Been to France one time and you're Parisian
Joined the real world, new season
Check my phone, check my pulse, ain't a reason
I kinda love it though

And I know you say you need me now (need me now)
Give me the runaround (runaround)
Which one am I with now?
She's got seven personalities, every one's a tragedy

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
I cannot help it if I like the way she makes me feel it

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it

So I build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again
Build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again
Build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again, oh

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
I cannot help it if I like the way she makes me feel it

I've been drunk three times this week
Spent all my money on a fleeting moment
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
Now I-I-I-I-I-I can't make this stop
Yeah, things were sweet three months ago
When I was living how I wanna on my own
And I thought I-I-I-I-I-I don't need that much
I guess I-I-I-I-I-I was out of touch

I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it

Yeah, I meant it

I gave up three times this week
Went through those feelings
Like I wasn't worth nothing
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
No, I-I-I-I-I-I can't be this soft

I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it

Yeah, I meant it

I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated

Yeah, I meant it
Yeah, I meant it

Dropping bombs in cups of coffee
You said it hits you all at once
I'm already tired and it's the morning
Then you clear your throat
Deep down I know that this is done
You tell me you're sorry and I'm laughing
You say sometimes these things just don't work out
'Cause you're only human, this shit happens
Wait, I don't mean to stop you
But darling, I have to cut you off

Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're using
Don't say, don't say you're human

Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

You say you've regret the way you acted
Come on, admit you let me down
Say that I'm better in your absence
Go right ahead, say almost anything you want

Just don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're using
Don't say, don't say you're human

Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're using
Don't say, don't say you're human
Just don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're using
Don't say, don't say you're human, oh

Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

No way, no way you're human

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

But she said, "Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this"

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

She said, "Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss
I want something just like this
I want something just like this"

Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this

You don't gotta say it, I know you ain't stayin' over
And I won't even mention the fact that you're never sober
I never know which side I'm gonna get tonight
And the closer we get, the less I think I know you

But you're just my type
The kind that only calls me late at night
You can't decide if you'll be yours or mine
I hate to say it, but you're just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah

Just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah
Just my type
Yeah, you're just my type, yeah, yeah

And I'm foolin' myself, 'cause I know that I'll never change ya
But you told me the truth, so I guess I can't really blame ya
No, you're not the one, but you're all I want, yeah
People say I'll get hurt, I don't know what they're so afraid of

But you're just my type
The kind that only calls me late at night
You can't decide if you'll be yours or mine
I hate to say it, but you're just my type

I know as the night goes on
You might end up with someone
So why do I bite my tongue?
Oh, I wanna know ya
I'm lookin' around the room
Is one of those strangers you?
And do you notice me too?
Oh, I wanna know ya

(I want ya) You're a face I won't forget
(I want ya) Don't know how much time is left
(I want ya) Haven't had a moment yet

Oh, dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one before you go
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
So why won't you stay a little longer?

Dance with me
Dance with me
(Mon amour)

You're putting your jacket on
Oh no, is the moment gone?
Don't wanna regret this one
Ooh, I wanna know ya

(I want ya) You're a face I won't forget
(I want ya) Don't know how much time is left
(I want ya) Haven't had a moment yet

Oh, dance with me, it won't kill ya

So why won't you just stay a little longer?
(So why won't you just stay a little longer?)

===================


We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, "Wow, if I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out"

Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought, "How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?"

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet

Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past we were livin' in

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris

Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are better

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris (if we go down)
We were staying in Paris (if we go down)
We were staying in Paris (if we go down)

Let's show them we are better

It's 5 a.m. and I'm on the radio
I'm supposed to call you, but I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to take her home
She don't really love me though, I'm just on the radio

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

It's 6 a.m., I'm so far away from you
I don't wanna let you down, what am I supposed to do?
It's been three weeks at least, now, since I've been gone
And I don't even like the road, I'm just on the radio

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

If I'm being honest

===================


Now I got cars, now I got clothes, now I got money
Now I got crowds screamin' my name sayin' they love me
You got real close, say I'm not alone, you understand me
But late at night, when I close my eyes, the quiet scares me

Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

Wake up alone
Wake up alone

I don't need cars, I don't need clothes, forget that money
'Cause if I go home all on my own, it ain't worth nothing

Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone

Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Or will I wake up alone?

Young
We were so young when we thought that we knew how to love
Fought about anything, everything led to dysfunction
But we just gotta own that shit
Don't let it go like this
Maybe we can grow from this, yeah

We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

Yeah, it's hard when you're young

Caught
We were caught up in the high, it was better than drugs
Too high to see that it would all lead to destruction
At least we both know that shit
We just gotta own that shit
I hope that we can grow from this, yeah

We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, yeah, it's hard when you're young

I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
Say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young

We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard

I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
Say what you want, but it's hard when you're young

Say what you want, but it's hard when you're young

You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young

===================


Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive

Bottled up in adolescence
Bottom up forbidden essence
Twisted up in adolescence
Waking up within your arms
I feel alive and dangerous
You're dangerous, we're dangerous

Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive

Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never (the last day alive)
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never
The last day alive

Promises within the air
Drowning in love affair
The night is young and we are young

Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive

Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never (the last day alive)
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never
The last day alive
The last day alive

Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive

I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I lay out all my reasons, you say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

And I say yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
And I say yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah

I'll tell them a story, they'll sit and nod their heads
I tell you all my secrets, and you tell all your friends
Hold on to your opinions, and stand by what you say (stand by what you say)
In the end, it's my decision, so it's my fault when it ends

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

And I say yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
And I say yeah-eah

But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

My friends say no-o, no-o-o
Then they don't know
No-o, no-o-o
Yeah, no-o, no-o-o
They don't know
No-o, no-o-o
No, no

You had one job!

Woke up on the West side
Listening to Beach House, taking my time
She's just my type
Dark hair wavin' out the passenger side
Then I start to think
As she pulls me on the bathroom floor
This is my type of thing
Yeah, yeah

Oh, darling of mine, where have you been?
I feel so alive with you in my bed
Oh, darling of mine, please don't let go
Just tell me you feel this, tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine

Oh, darling of mine

On a train through Japan
I keep her real close 'cause she knows who I am
Red pill in my hand
Paranoid cutie with a dark past and
It's that type of thing
When she feels like the girl next door
This is my type of thing
Yeah, yeah

Oh, darling of mine
Where have you been?
I feel so alive
With you in my bed
Oh, darling of mine
Please don't let go
Just tell me you feel this
Tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine

Oh, darling of mine
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?

And then I start to think as I lift her on the sink
That I've been here before
It's a certain type of fling, she gets bored of everything
Not the type you can ignore
Yeah, I just wanna taste as she grabs me by the waist
As she closes the door
She's taking what she wants, baby, you can have it all

Oh, darling of mine
Where have you been? (Where have you been?)
I feel so alive
With you in my bed (You in my bed)
Oh, darling of mine
Please don't let go (Please don't let go)
Just tell me you feel this
Tell me you know
Oh, darling of mine

Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah
Yeah-eah
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Where have you been?
Oh, darling of mine

===================


I would have walked through fire to kiss your lips
Do you still think about it, of what you did?
Still see your old apartment, like a bad trip
Wish I could forget all the places we've been

Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older, I can see why

You make me feel high
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my growth, growth, growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

Always another bender, I lose control
I thought I'd get it back when
You came back home to me, darling
But I never had it, did I? Your heart's a trick
And all the magic we felt was just a hit

Hard and heavy whiskey goodbyes
Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older, I can see why

You make me feel high
'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my growth, growth, growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know (Now that I know)
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

'Cause you had me so low
Now that I know
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my growth, growth, growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you
Now that I know (Now that I know)
That wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope

In the town full of fancy cars and
Crowded bars and supermodels
Looks exactly the way it did inside my head
When I dreamed about it
All the things I could live without
I need it now 'cause they're all around me
Only thing that I can't afford is to lose myself
Tryna be somebody, somebody

You should've known better
Than to listen to your heart again
People change with the weather

I don't really like anybody
So don't tell me I'm like anybody else
You put it back together
Don't let it fall apart again

It's 4AM, I don't know where to go
Everywhere is closed, I should just go home, yeah
My feet are taking me to your front door
I know I shouldn't though, heaven only knows

That ooh, the side effect to my loneliness is you

Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

This happens every time I try to mix
Decision making with one too many drinks

But, ooh, if late night friends have consequences, cool, yeah

Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight
Ooh, you're all that I want

Make it happen in my mind, I'm telling you, yeah
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line (yeah)
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead I got a message

I'm from the East side of America
Where we choose pride over character
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the West side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

And don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say, when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Where we're united under our indifference

And I'm from the East side of America
Where we desensitize by hysteria
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the West side of America

I am the, I am the, I am the sick boy

Feed yourself with my life's work
How many likes is my life worth?

Yeah, let's do it again but, uh, this time, uh, let's go full psycho

Yeah, I just want to drink tequila with my friends
She said she cheated 'cause she's tryna get ahead
The more I read it, yeah, the more I take offense
I'm so defeated, I can't get outside my head
I post a picture of myself 'cause I'm lonely
Everyone knows what I look like
Not even one of them knows me
Yeah, I just want to drink tequila with my friends
I'm so defeated I just want this shit to end

So I walk into the club like, everybody hates me
I walk into the club like, everybody hates me
I'm talkin' to myself, shit, now they think I'm crazy
I walk into the club like, everybody hates me (everybody hates me)
Like everybody hates me

Like everybody hates me (everybody, yeah)

I'm a product of the internet
Now, I'm face to face with all the voices in my head
I can't even check the time without facing regret
Why do I still have to mean everything I ever said
And I'm not trying to be like "poor me," I made it
I'm just trying to stay normal now that they know what my name is
Yeah, I just want to drink tequila with my friends
They're the reason that I stared at who I am

So I walk into the club like, everybody hates me
I walk into the club like, everybody hates me

Three weeks down, but you're on the mend
You swear that you're free from my passenger seat
As we drive through the night, yeah, it starts again
You blame it on me 'cause you're three pills deep

I tell myself I love the silence
But maybe I just wanna hear the sound of the sirens
I tell myself I love the silence
But maybe I just wanna hear the sound of the sirens

Here comes the sound of the sirens

I don't really say this that often
But there's something that the papers forgot
Every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they're painting but they can't leave a mark
Because my friends don't read the papers
And they don't really care if we're awesome or not
So every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they wanna see me hang on the wall

You don't know me
Don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead you owe me
If you're lonely
Don't you think you're on your own
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead you owe me

Say it to my face if you mean it
Say it to my face, but you won't
I know I'm not losing
But I'm losing my mi-ind
Does anybody know what that's like?

You don't know me
Don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead you owe me
If you're lonely
Don't you think you're on your own

Check my pulse and if I'm dead you owe me

If I'm dead, you owe me
If I'm dead, you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
You owe me, you owe me

I should have known what I started
You should know where your heart is
But I don't, I won't be a part of
Expectations when I grow up

So call it what you call it
But I just won't be afraid of myself
'Cause I know what I got in
I won't give it up just to save myself

1, 2, 3

1, 2, 3

I hit it till it's hollow
It's your pride, you should swallow
But I won't, I'm not one to follow
I won't explain all the things I love

So call it what you call it
I'll be the first one to blame myself
'Cause I know I get caught up
I won't give it up just to save myself

1, 2, 3

When Jason was at the table
I kept on seeing him look at me while he was with that other girl
Do you think he was just doing that to make me jealous?
Because he was totally texting me all night last night
And I don't know if it's a booty call or not
So... like what do you think?
Did you think that girl was pretty?
How did that girl even get in here?
Do you see her?
She's so short and that dress is so tacky
Who wears Cheetah?
It's not even summer, why does the DJ keep on playing "Summertime Sadness"?
After we go to the bathroom, can we go smoke a cigarette?
I really need one
But first,
Let me take a selfie

[Beat drops]

Can you guys help me pick a filter?
I don't know if I should go with XX Pro or Valencia
I wanna look tan
What should my caption be?
I want it to be clever
How about "Livin' with my bitches, hash tag LIVE"
I only got 10 likes in the last 5 minutes
Do you think I should take it down?
Let me take another selfie

[Beat drops]

Wait, pause, Jason just liked my selfie
What a creep
Is that guy sleeping over there?
Yeah, the one next to the girl with no shoes on
That's so ratchet
That girl is such a fake model
She definitely bought all her Instagram followers
Who goes out on Mondays?
OK, let's go take some shots
Oh no, ugh I feel like I'm gonna throw up
Oh wait, nevermind I'm fine
Let's go dance
There's no vodka at this table
Do you know anyone else here?
Oh my God, Jason just texted me
Should I go home with him?
I guess I took a good selfie

Selfie [x8]

Let me take a selfie

===================


I guess I took a good selfie (selfie...)

Let me take a selfie...
But first
Shut the fuck up

Let me take a another
Fuck no

Selfie...

Let me take a little selfie...
But first
Dish

===================


Two kids with their hearts on fire
Who's gonna save us now?
When we thought that we couldn't get higher
Things started looking down

I look at you and you look at me
Like nothin' but strangers now
Two kids with their hearts on fire
Don't let it burn us out

Think about what you believe in now
Am I someone you cannot live without?
'Cause I know I don't wanna live without you
Yeah
Come on let's turn this all around
Bring it all back to that bar downtown
When you wouldn't let me walk out on you
Yeah

You said, "Hey whatcha doing for the rest of your life?"
And I said
"I don't even know what I'm doing tonight"
Went from one conversation, to your lips on mine
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"
So I call you mine
Can I call you mine?
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"

Broke kids running through the city
Drunk on the subway train
Set free every time you kissed me
We couldn't feel no pain

You looked at me and I looked at you
Like we'd never look away
Broke kids running through the city
Don't let the memory fade

You said, "Hey whatcha doing for the rest of your life?"
And I said
"I don't even know what I'm doing tonight"
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"
So I call you mine
Can I call you mine?
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"

Think about what you believe in now
Am I someone you cannot live without?
'Cause I know I don't wanna live without you
Yeah
Come on let's turn this all around
Bring it all back to that bar downtown
When you wouldn't let me walk out on you, yeah

You said, "Hey whatcha doing for the rest of your life?"
And I said
"I don't even know what I'm doing tonight"
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"
So I call you mine
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?

[Andrew Taggart:]
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

[Wiz Khalifa:]
I know it breaks your heart
That I only smoke papers, 'cause I don't smoke 'gars, babe
I'm at an old school car take a joint to the face
And we both go far
Get high, can't stop
Let's get high, we can't stop
No

[Andrew Taggart:]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Andrew Taggart (Wiz Khalifa):]
We ain't ever getting older
(Khalifa man)
We ain't ever getting older

[Wiz Khalifa:]
Khalifa man, I'm fresh off of the plane
Been smoking so long I got my own strain
Roll up a joint and take it to the brain
Say you're getting high, but now you're speaking my language
Left with me as soon as we came
Spoke some bullshit, she'll never do it again
Try anything, she'll never do it again
Fuck Khalifa man, 'cause you'll never do it again

I know it breaks your heart
That I only smoke papers, 'cause I don't smoke 'gars, babe
I'm at an old school car take a joint to the face
And we both go far
And get high, can't stop
Let's get high, we can't stop
No

[Andrew Taggart & Halsey:]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older

Do you mean, do you mean what you say?
What you said, no, you can't take away
You're my gospel, but I'm losing faith, losing faith

Do you mean, do you mean what you say?
Take a minute, do you need to stop and think?
What we have, no, we can't throw away, throw away

Show me that you mean it, ay

You said you needed some space, girl
I tried to stay out your way, girl
You heard some stories about my past, hey
Wish we could leave them in the past, hey
You said it's hard for you to trust again
I wonder if you're really over it

Bounce back like a rebound
Are you saying what you mean now?

Do you mean, do you mean what you say?
What you said, no, you can't take away
You're my gospel, but I'm losing faith, losing faith

Time's up, what you gonna say next?
Can't hide what you did to me, yeah
Put you out like a cigarette
Put me out of my misery, yeah
It's not you it's me
Come on, seriously
Heard that once or twice before
You got that straight from a movie

Bounce back like a rebound
Are you saying what you mean now?

Do you mean, do you mean what you say?
What you said, no, you can't take away
You're my gospel, but I'm losing faith, losing faith

I have never wished and hoped
Didn't need a telescope
To see where I am going
I have never been the one
Trying hard to hold my tongue
Is my stereo

At one day I'll stand with a crown on my head
Like a God, yeah, like a God
With every step, no, I won't second guess what I want

I wanna be like Kanye
I'll be the king of me always
Do what I want, I'll have it my way
All day like Kanye-eah, yeah, yeah
Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah
Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah
I'll be the king of me

Born in broken home, okay
Single mama, let me chase what I was made for
We made out to Paradise,
Build on nickels, rubbing dimes
I'm entitled to so much more

One day I'll stand with a crown on my head
Like a God, yeah, like a God
With every step, no, I won't second guess what I want

I wanna be like Kanye
I'll be the king of me always
Do what I want, I'll have it my way
All day like Kanye-eah, yeah, yeah
Like Kanye, Kanye, yeah-ah, yeah-ah

===================


Made plans with me and all your friends
I'm late again, I hate to keep you waiting
Tried to be a gentleman
Got drunk again, before I even made it
Tried to call a car for you
You're tired of me, I knew you wouldn't take it
You walked a mile in LouisVuittons
And fucked em up, you know that they're my favorite

But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smiling, until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

Arguments that never end
You're talkin shit, to spice up conversation
I'm so sick of back and forth
These fights with you are starting to feel contagious
Said that I'm no good for you
Right before we walked into your parents'
Then you put on that smile again
And grabbed my hand, even though you hate it

But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smiling, until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smiling, until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
(Hold it, even though it kills you slowly)
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
(Explosions, hidden when we're in the open)
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
(Keep on smiling, until it's over)
Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
(Hold it, even though it kills you slowly)
Oh but, but it it, won't but, I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't

===================


You end up alone, after all that you've done
All that you've paid for
Did you get what you wanted?
You loaded a gun with all you were made of
When you're alone,
People don't think you know what you're made of, oh

Are you better than me?
It's not up to say, it's all that you wait for
Now I'll find a way, I'm seeing it through can you not be hateful.
While we're alive, can we relax, isn't that what are mates for?

You were there for me
And I was there for you
How will I let you go?
You will always be the one
That I regret
How will I let you go?

You're here in the way
How could you stay with all that I paid for?
Leave any time, won't let you wait
How could you be sure?
You're holding out hope
I'm seeing it too, I'm trying to follow, oh

I've been through hell and back again
I've come to understand that when
You tell me that I can't pretend
I either care about your stuff
Make the most of the things that might be rough
I let you go

Oh, holding out hope for you
Holding out hope,
Holding out hope for you

You were there for me
And I was there for you
How will I let you go?
You will always be the one that I regret
How will I let you go?
Let you go
Let you go
Let you go
Let you go

Oh, holding out hope for you
Holding out hope,
Holding out hope for you

You were there for me
And I was there for you
Oh oh, I remember times like that!
You will always be the one
That I regret
Ho-ow will I let you go?

Let you go
Let you go
Let you go
Let you go

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, "Wow, if I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out"
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought "How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else"

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

Broad street
Yeah, we met over sake
Might have started off rocky
And ruined our first date

But last night
When you finally called me
I ran straight through the lobby
I couldn't keep you waiting

And I know and I know and I know and I know
That you like your space with your one roommate
Do you mind if I see you tomorrow?

Yea I know yea I know yea I know yea I know
That you work sundays for minimum wage
Should I have known that you would take hold and never let go?
Never let go

I think I might push my luck with you
Does another night feel alright to you?
If I ask right now would you think it through?

Hey
I think I might push my luck with you
Did you say that you got nothing else to do?
Is it ok if I stay 'cause I'm dying to?
Yea I'm dying to

Restless
Tangled up in your mattress
In the morning we'll get dressed
The one that got away

You caught me
Yea I'm right where you want me
Every inch of my body
Won't let this go to waste

And I know and I know and I know and I know
That you like your space with your one roommate
Should I have known that you would take hold and never let go?
Never let go

I think I might push my luck with you
Does another night feel alright to you?
If I ask right now would you think it through?

Hey

Did you say that you got nothing else to do?
Is it ok if I stay 'cause I'm dying to?
Yea I'm dying to

I think I might push my luck with you
Does another night feel alright to you?
If I ask right now would you think it through?

Hey
I think I might push my luck with you
Did you say that you got nothing else to do?
Is it ok if I stay 'cause I'm dying to?
Yea I'm dying to

Under my skin
How deep I don't even know
Tried everything
But I don't anymore
Realizin'
I shouldn't have let you go
Shouldnt have let you go

Hardest part is knowing that I had it
Something almost perfect
We were almost perfect
Maybe it's too late for me to save this
But I gotta face this
No matter how I hate it

I need your love
To give me hope when I can't breathe
I need your love
To lift me up when I am weak
I need your love
When I hate every part of me
I need your love to set me free
I need your love
I need your love

I need your love
I need your love
When I hate every part of me
I need your love to set me free
I need your love
I need your love

I need your love
I need your love
When I hate every part of me
I need your love to set me free
I need your love

We got so close
But that dont mean anything
When it all comes around
I just want to fall again
Cuz im in a place
Where I dont feel anything
I dont feel anything

Hardest part is knowing that I had it
Something almost perfect
We were almost perfect
Maybe it's too late for me to save this
But I gotta face this
No matter how I hate it

I need your love
To give me hope when I can't breathe
I need your love
To lift me up when I am weak
I need your love
When I hate every part of me
I need your love to set me free
I need your love
I need your love

I need your love
I need your love tonight
I need your love
Just your love

I need your love tonight
Just need your love
I need your love
I need your love
Your love

I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
When I hate every part of me
I need your love to set me free

Don't lie, I know you've been thinking it
And two times you let it slip from your lips
You got too much pride to make any promises
Thinking that we got time and you wanna keep it in

I want you out in the pouring rain
I want you down on your knees
Praying to God that I feel the same
I'm right here baby, so please

Hold me up, tie me down
Cause I never wanna leave your side
I swear to never let you down
And it's been eatin' me alive
You can take me home, you can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up

And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down

Nine lives until you fall down my feet
Don't hide, it's a waste of your energy
You're not shy, so baby, it's useless
So don't try, cause you'll end up losing it

I want you out in the pouring rain
I want you down on your knees
Praying to God that I feel the same
I'm right here baby, so please

Hold me up, tie me down
Cause I never wanna leave your side
I swear to never let you down
And it's been eatin' me alive
You can take me home, you can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up

And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down

So wrap your arms around my chest
And I'll put my hands around your neck
Cause nobody wins this waiting game
You push and you pull, but you should stay
Stay

Hold me up, tie me down
Cause I never wanna leave your side
I swear to never let you down
And it's been eatin' me alive
You can take me home, you can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up

And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down
Down, down

===================


We started in the same neighborhood
Teenage hope misunderstood
Stars fell around us in a wasted place
We took your parents car out of town
Lost our minds til the sun went down
So we tried to grow up good one day

We were young, kind of foolish
Deep down love kind of friendship
Lost beneath in an endless wave
We gave up on the good life
Threw our souls to the high tide
Never thought it would end this way

We ain't best friends no more
Cuz I'm nothing like you
Two years, no love, no call
Now I'm nothing like you
I guess I'm riding solo
I guess I gotta let go
We ain't best friends no more
Cuz I'm nothing like you

(Cuz I'm nothing like you)

We used to keep our worlds tangled tight
Both our futures on one line
Just two tigers in a forest fire
But then we lost our stripes
We didn't care
You said you'd call, I was never there
Can we go back to the wilder life?

We were young kind of foolish
Deep down love kind of friendship
Lost beneath in an endless wave
We gave up on the good life
Threw our souls to the high tide
Never thought it would end this way

We ain't best friends no more
Cuz I'm nothing like you
Two years, no love, no call
Now I'm nothing like you
I guess I'm riding solo
I guess I gotta let go
We ain't best friends no more
Cuz I'm nothing like you

(Cuz I'm nothing like you)

===================


You love to talk without thinking
But never know what I'm thinking

The hardest part is believing, ooh
Then our love ain't just the season

Who cares what the world's gonna say?
'Cause you know they're gonna see it anyway
(And I know and I know that)
Who cares if they laugh at what we do?
'Cause it's only me and you that know the truth
(And I know and I know that)

Middle finger to the sky
They don't know 'bout you and I
We've been rollin' deeper than they'll ever know
Even though I broke your heart
No, that won't keep us apart, baby
I know, I know, not giving you up

If you want my love and you got it anytime you want it
Baby, bring your body back to me
They can call me foolish and stupid
Don't know why I do this
But, baby, bring your body back to me
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
(And I know and I know that)
I know, I know, I'm not giving you up
If you want my love and you got it anytime you want it
Baby, bring your body back to me

I know, I know, I'm not giving you up, giving you up
Baby, bring your body back to me

Who cares what the world's gonna think?
'Cause you know they're gonna think it anyway
(And I know and I know that)
I love all the bad things that we do
Shut you mouth and put your hands where I want you to
(And I know and I know that)

Middle finger to the sky
They don't know 'bout you and I
We've been rollin' deeper than they'll ever know
Even though I broke your heart
No, that won't keep us apart, baby

This ain't right and we know it
Be outta sight when I finish with this cup of coffee
It's the best time, we'll be golden
Don't wanna cry

'Cause I don't know where to go, but I'm going
And we say we'll stay in touch but we won't and
We're staying 'cause we're scared to be lonely
But we both know this ship sinking slowly

Don't wanna see you, wanna kiss you, wanna love you
But I don't wanna say "Bye," don't wanna say "Bye"
I got my reasons but I get caught in my feelings
And I don't wanna say "Bye," don't wanna say "Bye bye"
I don't wanna say "Bye bye," don't wanna say "Bye bye"
I got my reasons but I get caught in my feelings
And I don't wanna say "Bye," don't wanna say "Bye bye"
Don't wanna say "Bye bye," don't wanna say "Bye bye"

So tongue-tied 'cause we're talking
Just white lies 'cause I don't wanna
See you hurt in the good times
Come fight it, try not to cry

'Cause I don't know where to go, but I'm going
And we say we'll stay in touch but we won't and
We're staying 'cause we're scared to be lonely
But we both know this ship sinking slowly

Don't wanna see you, wanna kiss you, wanna love you
But I don't wanna say "Bye," don't wanna say "Bye"
I got my reasons but I get caught in my feelings
And I don't wanna say "Bye," don't wanna say "Bye bye"
I don't wanna say "Bye bye," don't wanna say "Bye bye"
I got my reasons but I get caught in my feelings
And I don't wanna say "Bye," don't wanna say "Bye bye"
Don't wanna say "Bye bye," don't wanna say "Bye bye"

I know I need to let you go
We need to cut these ties
But tell me that If I let you go
You will still be mine, ooh

Don't wanna see you, wanna kiss you, wanna love you
But I don't wanna say "Bye," don't wanna say "Bye"
I got my reasons but I get caught in my feelings
And I don't wanna say "Bye," don't wanna say "Bye bye"
(I got my reasons but I get caught in my feelings)
I don't wanna say "Bye bye," don't wanna say "Bye bye"
(I got my reasons but I get caught in my feelings)
I got my reasons but I get caught in my feelings
And I don't wanna say "Bye," don't wanna say "Bye bye"
Don't wanna say "Bye bye," don't wanna say "Bye bye"

No, I don't wanna
No, I don't wanna say
No, I don't wanna say goodbye
No, I don't wanna
No, I don't wanna say
No, I don't wanna say goodbye

See a million faces
Sliding down below
Awful lot of strangers
Only one I'm lookin' for
It's lonely in this cabin
God, I wanna know
Are you with somebody else
Who'd never let you go?

I want another life in
A brand new galaxy where
There ain't no sense of time and
There ain't no gravity

If I left the world
Would anybody miss me while I
Look down on this city thinkin'
Should have loved you more
And maybe you'd be with me, darling
If I hadn't gone and left the world

If I, if I, if I, if I
If I hadn't gone and left the world

If I, if I, if I, if I
If I hadn't gone and left the world

Been a lot of places
And none of them were home
Always told myself that I'd be
Better off alone
Float up from my body
Been longing for the moon
Look her in the eye and tell her
I'ma see you soon

I want another life in
A brand new galaxy where
There ain't no sense of time and
There ain't no gravity

If I left the world
Would anybody miss me while I
Look down on this city thinkin'
Should have loved you more
And maybe you'd be with me, darling
If I hadn't gone and left the world

If I, if I, if I, if I
If I hadn't gone and left the world

If I, if I, if I, if I
If I hadn't gone and left the world

If I left the world
Would anybody miss me while I
Look down on this city thinkin'
Should have loved you more
And maybe you'd be with me, darling
If I hadn't gone and left the world

===================


Elevator doors close on you
And just a second ago
I spilled the truth
I told you I had feelings
Feelings for you
And you kissed me

If you wanna rewind the tape
I'll show you how you just
Confessed your mistakes
And I still stayed because I
Wanted to stay
Stay with you

But I can't get you out of my mind
So baby I'm going out of my mind
No I can't get you out of my mind
So baby I'm going out of my mind
Cause the more I'm trying to forget
The more you're running through my head
And I can't get you out of my mind
So baby I'm going out of my mind

Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my...

We always keep it honest but I
Don't know if I was way too
Honest this time
You disappeared and I still
Miss how you lie
Do you miss me?

Tell me now what do you expect
Do you expect me to me
Forgive and forget
Like nothing happened I should
Want this to end
Shouldn't want you

But I can't get you out of my mind
So baby I'm going out of my mind
No I can't get you out of my mind
So baby I'm going out of my mind
Cause the more I'm trying to forget
The more you're running through my head
And I can't get you out of my mind
So baby I'm going out of my mind

Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my...

But I can't get you out of my mind
So baby I'm going out of my mind
No I can't get you out of my mind
So baby I'm going out of my mind
Cause the more I'm trying to forget
The more you're running through my head
And I can't get you out of my mind
So baby I'm going out of my mind
Out of my mind

===================


I moved miles and miles to get out of your space
But I still see your smile, still on every face
And I bring all of the shit I got from you now
Whenever I move on to someone new now

I look out for your grey car, when I'm out on the road
And when I roll the paper, it's the way that you showed
And I wear all of the habits that you gave me
Right next to all the crazy that you made me

I never wanna, never wanna, never wanna think about you again
But I do sometimes
I never wanna, never wanna, never wanna think about you again
But you left all your baggage in my head
You left all your baggage in my head
You made it impossible to forget
Cause you left all your baggage in my head
You left all your baggage

See I used to be open, I was never afraid
I put all my trust in a feeling, when somebody said love I believed it
Now I wear all of the habits that you gave me
Right next to all the crazy that you made me

I never wanna, never wanna, never wanna think about you again
But I do sometimes
I never wanna, never wanna, never wanna think about you again
But you left all your baggage in my head
You left all your baggage in my head
You made it impossible to forget
Cause you left all your baggage in my head
You left all your baggage

You left all your baggage in my head
You left all your baggage in my head
You left all your baggage

And you made it impossible for me to forget
And I tried

I never wanna, never wanna, never wanna think about you again
I never wanna, never wanna, never wanna think about you again
But you left all your baggage in my head
You left all your baggage in my head
You made it impossible to forget
Cause you left all your baggage in my head
You left all your baggage

You left all your baggage
You left all your baggage

===================


I'll tell you something you need to know
Nothing I can say from the phone
I'll tell you something, we have to see 'cause
You're the one that I miss the most

I've heard that you're happy
And maybe it's selfish of me
To want you back this time
I know we decided if we both were free
But it kills me now

We said our last goodbye
Won't you stay the night?
Even just for a moment
Perfect night, pretend we're fine
Even just for a moment
Nowhere over, we're still not over
Pull me closer, I need closure
This is our last goodbye
Stay the night, even just for a moment
Even just for a moment

When you're not hurting
It's hurting me (hurting me)
I'm blinded by the past
I'm lost at sea (mm)

I've heard that you're happy
And maybe it's selfish of me
To want you back this time
I know we decided if we both were free
But it kills me now

We said our last goodbye
Won't you stay the night?
Even just for a moment
Perfect night, pretend we're fine
Even just for a moment
Nowhere over, we're still not over
Pull me closer, I need closure
This is our last goodbye
Stay the night, even just for a moment
Even just for a moment
Even just for a moment

We said our last goodbye
Won't you stay the night
Even just for a moment?
Perfect night, pretend we're fine
Even just for a moment
Nowhere over, we're still not over
Pull me closer, I need closure
This is our last goodbye
Stay the night, even just for a moment
Even just for a moment
Won't you stay the night
Even just for a moment?
Even just for a moment

We said our last goodbye
Won't you stay the night
Even just for a moment?
Perfect night, pretend we're fine
Even just for a moment

===================


No chemical could recreate our chemistry
Got what I need, need, need
I'm technical, but I lose sensibility
When you're next to me

I feel a boom, feel a bang inside my soul, love
When you lay me down
When you do it that way, I lose control, love
Of my senses now

You got me flying and falling till four in the morning
Can you hear my body is calling your name?

Like oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you ooh ooh
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now

(Ooh now) (Hey)

Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
I think I might love you ooh ooh
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now

I go from zero to a million when you dim the lights
You get me high, high, high
When you whisper in my ear, I hear a lullaby
So sing to me all night

I feel the boom, feel the bang from head to toe, love
When you caress me down
When you do it that way, I lose control, love
You know you got me now

You got me flying and falling till four in the morning
Can you hear my body is calling your name?

Like oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you ooh ooh
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now

(Ooh now) (Hey)

Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
I think I might love you ooh ooh
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now

You got me flying and falling till four in the morning
Can you hear my body is calling your name?
And when you're gone, you should know that you're all that I'm wanting
And I'll always be feeling the same

Like oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now
Oh my God, ooh
I think I might love you, ah
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
The way I love it when you touch me now

Oh my God
I think I might love you
Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now

Oh my God, ooh (Hey)
I think I might love you (I think I might love you)
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now

(You remind me)
(You remind me)

I wouldn't say that I'm sorry
I wouldn't say that I would do it for someone else

In every way you're my opposite
I feel your heartbeat wherever I go

But I need you more now everyday
And I try, yeah, you know I do
But nothing can compare
No, nothing can compare to you

===================


Hurt people hurt people's how it begins
And I don't wanna cause you pain
This ain't the way that I thought we would live

When I start to feel I'm in trouble again
I just keep it as friends 'cause I know how it ends
When I feel like I'll be the devil again
I'll sit back and pretend like we both never met

I found courage at 16 but lost it at 23
I'm not okay, I'm not okay
And I lost my self-esteem believin' in a dream
I lost my faith, I lost my faith, oh

Hurt people hurt people's how it begins
And I don't wanna cause you pain
This ain't the way that I thought we would live

You might think that I'm crazy
You might think you can save me
I wish it was that easy, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hurt people hurt people, that's how it ends
And I don't wanna cause you pain, ay-ay, ay-ain
No, I don't wanna cause you pain, ay-ay, ay-ain
No, I don't wanna cause you pain

When the cracks appear and we fall in between
Oh, you suddenly see this is far from your dreams
When the chaos comes and we're sleepless awake
I'm a slave to my ways, you deserve better days

You found courage at 16 and lost it when you met me
That's not okay, it's not okay
So don't lose your self-esteem believin' in a dream
And lose your way, don't lose your faith, oh

Hurt people hurt people's how it begins
And I don't wanna cause you pain
This ain't the way that I thought we would live, oh

You might think that I'm crazy
You might think you can save me
I wish it was that easy, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hurt people hurt people, that's how it ends
And I don't wanna cause you pain, ay-ay, ay-ain
No, I don't wanna cause you pain, ay-ay, ay-ain
No, I don't wanna cause you pain

Why won't you hear me when I say
You're way too good for me anyway?
Why won't you hear me when I say
You're way too good for me anyway?

Hurt people hurt people's how it begins
And I don't wanna cause you pain
This ain't the way that I thought we would live, ooh

You might think that I'm crazy (Crazy)
You might think you can save me (Save me)
I wish it was that easy (Easy), oh, oh, oh, oh
Hurt people hurt people, that's how it ends
And I don't wanna cause you pain, ay-ay, ay-ain
No, I don't wanna cause you pain, ay-ay, ay-ain
No, I don't wanna cause you pain

Cause you pain
I don't wanna cause you pain

===================


Thought I saw you at our bar last night
Hid in the bathroom, I just couldn't stay high

'Cause I took so much time to reset my life
But in just one look, I'm back
Forget that I could have any one I like
But now all I remember is what we had

Nobody, nobody, nobody compares to you
Somebody, somebody please help me get over you
'Cause it feels like I've been wasting my time
In all the wrong places, on all the wrong faces
Nobody compares to you
Nobody compares to you
Nobody compares to you

Nobody compares to you
Nobody compares to you

What should I do?
Maybe I'll move away
Start somewhere new, I'll let you have LA

'Cause I took so much time to reset my life
But in just one look, I'm back
Forget that I could have any one I like
But now all I remember is what we had

Nobody, nobody, nobody compares to you
Somebody, somebody please help me get over you
'Cause it feels like I've been wasting my time
In all the wrong places, on all the wrong faces
Nobody compares to you
Nobody compares to you
Nobody compares to you

Nobody compares to you
Nobody compares to you

You're once in a lifetime
Better than New Year's at midnight
Wanna grab on and hold tight
And I won't let go
I hope you can hear this
'Cause it's your face that I miss
Your lips I wanna kiss

Nobody, nobody, nobody compares to you
Somebody, somebody please help me get over you
'Cause it feels like I've been wasting my time
In all the wrong places, on all the wrong faces
Nobody compares to you

Nobody compares to you
Nobody, nobody, nobody compares to you

===================


Yeah, I doubt, I doubt myself
And I'm too proud to ask for help
When you see me beside myself
I don't have to explain it, baby
Yeah, I'm over picking fights
And tryna mend it with the high
Don't wanna know that I'm not right
I know that I've been lately, lately

Yeah, sometimes I need someone to pick me up
Overdose my mind with the things I love
You can take me there, where my heart beats
Where my heart beats free

Take my hand in the middle of a crisis
Pull me close, show me, baby, where the light is
I was scared of a heart I couldn't silence
But you make me, you make me feel good, I like it
Take my hand in the middle of a crisis
Pull me close, show me, baby, where the light is
I was scared of a heart I couldn't silence
But you make me, you make me feel good, I like it

You make me, you make me feel good

Yeah, I get over-overwhelmed
When all these problems burn like hell
Maybe I just need a friend
Who never calls me crazy, crazy

You pull me off the front
Line before I run
Keep me cool, but not
Get overdone
You can take me there, where my heart speaks
Where my heart speaks free

Take my hand in the middle of a crisis
Pull me close, show me, baby, where the light is
I was scared of a heart I couldn't silence
But you make me, you make me feel good, I like it
Take my hand in the middle of a crisis
Pull me close, show me, baby, where the light is
I was scared of a heart I couldn't silence
But you make me, you make me feel good, I like it

You make me, you make me feel good, I like it, I like it
You make me, you make me feel good

Taking the weights off (oh)
To help with the pressure
And I was here stressing
Thinking it mattered
Been with you for hours, but it feels like seconds
It's only moments and I'm in heaven
It's only moments and I'm in heaven, oh

You make me feel good
You make me feel good
You make me, you make me feel good, I like it

Take my hand in the middle of a crisis
Pull me close, show me, baby, where the light is
I was scared of a heart I couldn't silence
But you make me, you make me feel good, I like it

===================


I won't stop, I won't look down
I tried all my tricks, I broke all-new ground
And in this final hour, look what I found
I got this whole damn thing the wrong way around

Cause people gonna judge and people gonna talk
And they can say what they like
Won't keep me up at night, no
People gonna judge and people gonna talk
And they can say what they like
Won't keep me up at night

Maybe we're still lost
Maybe we'll never learn
But as the dust settles down and I'm glad you're here
I feel I'm finally headed home

Moments stuck all over you
That's what I need and that's what we'll do
I could walk a mile in your shoes
I know how it feels to dance like you

Cause people gonna judge and people gonna talk
And they can say what they like
Won't keep me up at night, no
People gonna judge and people gonna talk
And they can say what they like
Won't keep me up at night

Maybe we're still lost
Maybe we'll never learn
But as the dust settles down and I'm glad you're here
I feel I'm finally headed home

===================


Show me how we move
Now I'm learning
Three is more than two
You are the one I see
You are a half of me
As much as we bare our souls, we're animals
I'm aching to see my boy lose control

I know that we could leave our love in ruins
And bury this six feet in the grave
But I wanna know the hurt that hits
When you kiss her lips
So why don't we play a game?
I know that we could leave our love in ruins
Or maybe we should both be unafraid
I wanna see you bend the rules
Me and you

I know that we could leave our love in ruins
And bury this six feet in the grave
But I wanna know the hurt that hits
When you kiss her lips
So why don't we play a game?

Show me how she moves
All this time and
We're too strong to lose
And I promise you
You are the one I see
You are a half of me
As much as we share our souls, we're animals
I'm aching to see my boy lose control

I know that we could leave our love in ruins
And bury this six feet in the grave
But I wanna know the hurt that hits
When you kiss her lips
So why don't we play a game?
I know that we could leave our love in ruins
Or maybe we should both be unafraid
I wanna see you bend the rules
Me and you

(So why don't we play a game?)
I know that we could leave our love in ruins
And bury this six feet in the grave
But I wanna know the hurt that hits
When you kiss her lips
So why don't we play a game?

===================


We got problems in the streets again
Drowning in the violence, it's getting pretty tense
A lot of hunger in the faces I see
A lot of bitterness, communal emptiness

Don't trust the water, friend
Chemicals hide with the skeletons
Don't trust that false pretense
Counterfeit lies are your best defense

I said, you've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart
You've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart

We got issues that we can't change
As quickly as we'd like to, as we need to
And I'm worried it will back spin
Pulling out the lynch pin, leaving us victims

Don't trust the water, friend
Chemicals hide with the skeletons
Don't trust that false pretense
Counterfeit lies are your best defense

I said, you've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart
You've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart

I said, you've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go

Head first, past the point of no return
It's the only way left to go
Can't keep taking while the years go by
Gotta go whole heart this time
You gotta go whole heart
You gotta go whole heart this time
You gotta go whole heart this time

I said, you've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart
You've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go

I said, you've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart

===================


Gone away, gonna fade
Let me charge my phone
Roll away on a wave
Yea we hit the road
Cause tonight we can let go
For a week or so
We got all the shit we need
We're on 10 every day
It ain't nothing new
Iced tea lemonade for me and the crew
Throw the night away
Shoot us through the moon
You'll just have to drive through

And my momma don't know what I need, need
When my daddy left me with the keys, keys
So goddamn, I'm ballin' like a man
I'm sitting shotgun in a six wheel van

We're on our way though
In a Winnebago
We'll reserve you a table
And some jumper cables

Putting gas in the tank
Got me acting rude
Mary Jane in the back
And she in the mood
We ain't got a plan
That shit hit the fan
Ain't nobody having fun like we do

And my momma don't know what I need, need
When my daddy left me with the keys, keys
Goddamn, I'm ballin' like a man
I'm sitting shotgun in a six wheel van

We're on our way though
In a Winnebago
We'll reserve you a table
And some jumper cables

And my momma don't know what I need, need
When my daddy left me with the keys, keys
Goddamn, I'm ballin' like a man
I'm sitting shotgun in a six wheel van

We're on our way though
In a Winnebago
We'll reserve you a table
And some jumper cables

We're on our way though
In a Winnebago
We'll reserve you a table
And some jumper cables

===================


When you're screaming out
But you can't make a sound
You know
It's only a dream
When your back hits the ground
And things turn around
You know
It was only a dream

Cause nothing is as bad as you think
Even when you're pulling at the seams
When the lights go out you still got me
Detours lead to barricades
And home is far, your friends are fake
I'll be there to clear the way

And you
You know my love can hold you down
You know my love can hold you down
And you
You know my love can hold you down
You know my love can hold you down

When the roof caves in
And you just can't win
You know
It'll only get better, only get better
When you fall too far
Can't go back to the start
You know
It'll only get better, only get better

Nothing is as bad as you think
Even when you're pulling at the seams
When the lights go out you still got me
Detours lead to barricades
And home is far, your friends are fake
I'll be there to clear the way

And you
You know my love can hold you down
You know my love can hold you down
And you
You know my love can hold you down
You know my love can hold you down

===================


No light in the distance
We were shadows holding on (Holding on)
All the things I resisted
Now far from gone (Far from gone)

Armor on
You use your heart as a fortress
Ticking bombs
All the weapons are useless
So can you just let down your guard
Before everything is marred
Armor on
You use your heart as a fortress

How’d you get so far away from me
How’d you get so far away from me
How’d you get so far
How’d you get so far away

How’d you get so far away
You use your heart as a fortress
You use your heart as a fortress
You use your heart as a fortress

How’d you get so far
How’d you get so far
Armor on
You use your heart as a fortress
Ticking bombs
All the weapons are useless

All the weapons are useless
You use your heart as a fortress
So can you just let down your guard
Before everything is marred
Armor on
You use your heart as a fortress

You use your heart as a fortress
You use your heart as a fortress

===================


You hate when my head
Hangs low after all
These things you said
Trust it's not your fault
Can’t expect you to understand
Take it back to when it began
Had I just followed all my plans
I wouldn’t have ended up so lost
Now we’re both so off
And I’m still the one to blame
Can’t say we’ll stay the same
Can’t say we’ll stay the same

Baby, baby stay here
I need some time to clear my mind
We both know it’s a problem
When you call me all the time
And I’ll say
I may just need a little bit longer, yeah
I may just need you to be stronger
If I’m not there with you

If I’m not there with you
I can’t hold this fight in anymore
If I’m not there with you
I can’t hold this fight in anymore

Baby, baby stay here
I need some time to clear my mind
We both know it’s a problem
When you call me all the time
And I’ll say
I may just need a little bit longer, yeah
I may just need you to be stronger
If I’m not there with you

If I’m not there with you
If I’m not there with you
If I’m not there with you
If I’m not there with you

===================


Sleepwalker, where do you go
In the night
I find you in my dreams
I find you in my dreams
Sleepwalker, visions always
Just repeat
You’re always in my dreams
You’re always in my dreams

Did you come to make it right
Did you come to say goodbye
Did you come to make it right
Did you come to say goodbye
Did you come to say goodbye
Did you come to say goodbye
Sleepwalker, sleepwalker
Where did you go

Now I’m sleepwalking again
Now I’m sleepwalking again
Now I’m sleepwalking again
Now I’m sleepwalking again
Sleepwalker, sleepwalker
Sleepwalker, sleepwalker

Sleepwalker, sleepwalker
Sleepwalker, sleepwalker
Now I’m sleepwalking again
Now I’m sleepwalking again
Sleepwalker, sleepwalker
Sleepwalker
Where did you go

Now I’m sleepwalking again
Now I’m sleepwalking again
Now I’m sleepwalking again
Now I’m sleepwalking again

Sleepwalker, sleepwalker
Sleepwalker, sleepwalker

===================


At first I didn’t think that I was cut enough to bleed
Then I saw my secrets getting swallowed by the sea
Through a telescope
I saw a diamond glow
How you brought me home
I guess I’ll never know

With god as my witness
Never had it so good
Jumping into love
Fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothing
Now it’s gold
And it’s all on you

With god as my witness
Never had it so good
Jumping into love
Fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothing
Now it’s gold
And it’s all on you

(I get my kicks from you
I get my kicks from you)

Can’t see, dark road, driving up the hills
Looking at the girl, hand barely on the wheel
Got no where to go
We can take it slow
How you brought me home
I guess I’ll never know

I get my kicks from you
I get my kicks from you

With god as my witness
Never had it so good
Jumping into love
Fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothing
Now it’s gold
And it’s all on you

And it’s all on you
And it’s all on you
And it’s all on you

Kicks from you
I get my kicks from you

===================


Remember when you asked me to paint you all my dreams
I told you a sailboat no compass just us and an open sea
I’ll sing like a siren, our island is floating
The sail in the blue sky is our only curtain
I’ll show you a spiral
Staircase that only your eyes can see

I’ll spin your walls around
Around like spirals
Won’t you go all the way down
Down like spirals, like spirals
Like spiral stairs to a cave by the ocean
Unravel all for you
All for you
All for you

Remember when our paradise was green grapevines and leaves
Do you remember when the shorelines grew for you and me
I’ll build you a house where the hallways will always
Lead you to bedrooms where i will be waiting
I’ll show you a spiral
Staircase that only your eyes can see

I’ll spin your walls around
Around like spirals
Won’t you go all the way down
Down like spirals, like spirals
Like spiral stairs to a cave by the ocean
Unravel all for you
All for you
All for you

===================


I feel you
Shutting down
After we've had one too many
Of these talks
You say you wanna stay
But I know you'd rather get up and walk away

Can you hear me
I'm crying out for you
I'm crying out for you again
I'm not ready
To let this go
We've come too far

And I won't ask you to stay
But promise well be okay
Running out of time
I'll let you clear your mind
I just hope you can find a way

Cause I can't wait a little bit longer
And I can't be a little bit stronger
And know things won't be the same
But I'm willing to take the blame
Cause I don't wanna be without you
I don't wanna be without you

I'm not me
And you're not you
When we're fighting like this
Can't we just go back to where we were
I know you think I'm naive
But I know that you're worth fighting for and I believe

And I won't ask you to stay
But promise well be okay
Running out of time
I'll let you clear your mind
I just hope you can find a way

Cause I can't wait a little bit longer
And I can't be a little bit stronger
And know things won't be the same
But I'm willing to take the blame
Cause I don't wanna be without you
I don't wanna be without you

I don't wanna be without you
Cause I don't wanna be without you
I don't wanna be without you

===================


Only one, only one [x4]

I guess I'll be the first to say it:
I haven't felt this good in a while
You tell me I'm the only one that they would all like
But you're the only one that kept me alive

You are the only one
You are the only one that kept me alive
You were the only one, the only one that was on my side
You were the only one that kept me alive

Even after all this time
Fear can grip me at night
But somehow, somewhere you make me believe
I could see it in your eyes
So take me as your breathing proof
For everything you've ever done for me
I won't lie and fear no more
I hope you realize:
You kept me alive

You are the only one
You are the only one that kept me alive
You were the only one, the only one that was on my side
You were the only one that kept me alive

You saw my insides from the outside
You saw a chance, gave me truth so I survived
Saw my insides from the outside
You saw my insides from the outside
You took a chance, gave me proof without a goodbye
Now here I am, just happy to be alive

You are the only one
You are the only one that kept me alive
You were the only one, the only one that was on my side
You were the only one that kept me alive

You are the only one
Only one, only one [x4]

===================


So, I'll be your reason
We won' talk again

After we’re gone
Who will breathe the earth we lost
We leave nothing but our thoughts
And memories beneath the dust
So when this body fails to mend
And all my demons they come crashing in
Will I start to begin
Or will I fade away with them

And in the afterlife, tell me we’ll be fine
In the afterlife, tell me we’ll be fine
And in the afterlife, tell me we’ll be fine
In the afterlife

And in the afterlife, tell me we’ll be fine
In the afterlife, tell me we’ll be fine
And in the afterlife, tell me we’ll be fine
In the afterlife

So when this body fails to mend
And all the demons they come crashing in
Will we start to begin
Or will we fade away with them

And in the afterlife, tell me we’ll be fine
In the afterlife, tell me we’ll be fine
And in the afterlife, tell me we’ll be fine
In the afterlife

And in the afterlife, tell me we’ll be fine
In the afterlife, tell me we’ll be fine
And in the afterlife, tell me we’ll be fine
In the afterlife

===================


I could count them if I want to
All these years I've wasted on you
You gave up, I grew up
I can't help, but wonder

Where would I, where would I be? What would I do?
If you were, if you were there when I needed you
Where would I, where would I be? What would I do?
If you were, if you were there when I needed you

What would I
I-I-I, do, I-I-I, do, I-I-I, do, I-I-I
Needed you
I-I-I, do, I-I-I, do, I-I-I, do
Needed you

What would I

I could count them if I want to
All these years I've wasted on you
You gave up, I grew up
I can't help, but wonder

Where would I, where would I be? What would I do?
If you were, if you were there when I needed you
Where would I, where would I be? What would I do?
If you were, if you were there when I needed you

What would I
I-I-I, do, I-I-I, do, I-I-I, do, I-I-I
Needed you
I-I-I, do, I-I-I, do, I-I-I, do
Needed you

===================


We were so bright
Standing in the sunlight
Never got burnt, we were alright
Had that easy kind of love and I let it in
For a moment
Felt like we were floating
Baby, I swear, we were golden
It was easy, natural as breathing air

And when the sky went dark
You think I would have known
Before we let it get this far
I should have let you go

Now I gotta crawl outta love
Now I gotta crawl outta love
It's so fucking easy to fall in
But now that this ain't what you promised
And tell me how to crawl outta love

Tell me how to–
Now I gotta crawl outta, crawl outta love
Tell me how to–
Now I gotta crawl outta, crawl outta love

Got your words right
Always knew what to say in our fights
Look at us now, hard as I try
I get halfway up the wall and you pull me down

And when the sky went dark
You think I would have known
Before we let it get this far
I should have let you go

Now I gotta crawl outta love
Now I gotta crawl outta love
It's so fucking easy to fall in
But now that this ain't what you promised
Tell me how to crawl outta love

Now I gotta crawl outta, crawl outta love
Tell me how to–
Now I gotta crawl outta, crawl outta love

Crawl outta, crawl outta
Crawl outta, crawl outta love
Crawl outta, crawl outta
And when the sky went dark
You think I would have known
Before we let it get this far
I should have let you go

Now I gotta crawl outta love
Now I gotta crawl outta love
It's so fucking easy to fall in
But now that this ain't what you promised
Tell me how to crawl outta love

Now I gotta–
Tell me how to crawl outta, crawl outta love
Tell me how to–
Now I gotta crawl outta, crawl outta love

No time like now

I couldn't tell you, I couldn't breathe
I never knew that I was ripping at the seams
I couldn't hold back, I didn't try
One look and you're right between my lines

It's like you're diving in to my heart
I'm floating off the ground
When you pull me in to your arms

I go into a free fall
I'm spinning and I can't stop
I lose my breath when you say my name
I go into a free fall
I'm spinning and I can't stop
I lose myself and now I'm not the same
When we're in a free fall

We're in a free fall

Never felt like, this before
Got the thrill and now I only want more
Scared to look down, but gravity
Can't compete with all the light you give in me

It's like you're diving in to my heart
I'm floating off the ground
When you pull me in to your arms

I go into a free fall
I'm spinning and I can't stop
I lose myself and I'm not the same
I go into a free fall
I'm spinning and I can't stop
I lose myself and now I'm not the same
When we're in a free fall

I go into a free fall
I'm spinning and I can't stop
I lose myself and now I'm not the same
When we're in a free fall

===================


Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?

Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?

Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?

Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?

===================


Burning everything I know
Desperate for a change
Crashing down the ancient roads
Past our yesterday

Maybe there is hunger in my blood
Screaming out loud for what I want
See me running full speed at it
Shattering, collide
Call it post-traumatic
Now it's do or die

Coming after tiny fractures
Coming after tiny fractures
See me running full speed at it
Coming after tiny fractures
Call me post-traumatic
What comes after, tiny fractures

Tiny fractures...

Feeding frenzy is in my brain
I'm hopeful every day
I gotta get it while we are still young enough to break
We're finally not afraid

Maybe there is hunger in my blood
Screaming out loud for what I want
See me running full speed at it
Shattering, collide
Call me post-traumatic
Now it's do or die

Coming after tiny fractures
Coming after tiny fractures
See me running full speed at it
Coming after tiny fractures
Call it post-traumatic
What comes after, tiny fractures

Tiny fractures...

===================


Hey, just seeing how you're doing
I just wanted to say that I miss you, I guess
And I'm sorry
Call me back
Bye

So tell me how I'm supposed to feel now
60 over the limit just 'cause I can
They say, "You know, you gotta slow down"
There's no coming back
So young and restless, I'm a cliché, yeah
But it's easier said than done

And I can't keep waiting here
I'm just aging
So I'm gone
Such a shame

But baby, I'm leaving
Before tomorrow comes
I don't believe in saying I'm never coming home
But I'm drawing the line, and say whatever you like
But I'm leaving
I'm letting go of all I've ever known

So falling in and falling out fast
I'm burning up, I can't believe this got old so fast
And I'm done with feeling like I'm told I should
'Cause it's a feeling I'm chasing
And I ain't found it here in a while

But I can't keep waiting here
I'm just aging
So I'm gone
Such a shame

But baby, I'm leaving
Before tomorrow comes
I don't believe in saying I'm never coming home
But I'm drawing the line, and say whatever you like
But I'm leaving
I'm letting go of all I've ever known

'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving

===================


It's back to the basics without you now
I'm trying not to fall under
You told me I should take a look around
Lost it all and it's no wonder

How it came to be
I'm stepping out the door of you and me
I'm crossing out the eyes and what they've seen
I'm better off, I'm better off, I'm better

It's time for me to breathe
I'm gasping for the air you stole from me
I'm crossing out the eyes and what they've seen
I'm better off, I'm better off, I'm better lost

Lost
I'm better lost
Lost
I'm better lost

Been down on defeat
Rose from beneath
To find my escape
I'll run from the lies
You tried to hide
I'll vanish without a trace

It's time for me to breathe
I'm gasping for the air you stole from me
I'm crossing out the eyes and what they've seen
I'm better off, I'm better off, I'm better lost

(Now, oh without you, without you now
Now, oh oh-out you, oh-out you now)

I'm better lost
I'll never need you
To see through
Yeah, I'm better lost

I'm better lost
I'll never need you
To see through
Yeah, I'm better lost

I'm better lost
I'm better lost
I'm better lost
I'll never need you
I'm better lost

===================


I've been quiet aside you
While my heart in my chest shouts
Feeling silenced and lied to
But enough is enough

Don't come find me, I won't be here waiting
I so can do it alone, you're not worth staying

Weren't listening but now there's no way you won't hear
There's a voice emerging in the night so loud and clear
I'll turn it up like you turn me down, I'm not afraid
Hit play, hit play
It's the sound of walking away

It's the sound of walking away
It's the sound of walking away
It's the sound of walking away

I've been drowning inside you
While my love it just pours out
I've been running behind you
But enough is enough

Don't come find me, I won't be here waiting
I so can do it alone, you're not worth staying

Weren't listening but now there's no way you won't hear
There's a voice emerging in the night so loud and clear
I'll turn it up like you turn me down, I'm not afraid
Hit play, hit play
It's the sound of walking away

It's the sound of walking away
It's the sound of walking away

===================


You're taking me higher
You're taking me
You're taking me higher
You're taking me
You're taking me higher
You're taking me
You're taking me higher
You're taking me

You're taking me higher
You're taking me
You're taking me higher
You're taking me
You're taking me higher
You're taking me
You're taking me higher
You're taking me

===================


Can't see the stars, but we're reaching
Trying to get through the dark on a feeling
Lost our gravity, now we're weightless
But I know in my heart we can take this

We got monsters in our closets
Had a reason but we lost it
No direction, we've been calling
Through the night, through the night

If love is a lie, then why do we need it?
We swear we're alive, but we're falling to pieces
We fight like lions, we howl at the moon
We should be flying instead we bury the truth
But I know inside we're beautiful creatures (beautiful)

We're beautiful creatures

When your highs are low, keep the faith yeah
Cause you know that a life's never wasted
Standing tall, shaking off the dust, oh yeah
Now we know, now we know what we're made of, ooh

We got monsters in our closets
Had a reason but we lost it
No direction, we've been calling
Through the night, through the night

If love is a lie, then why do we need it?
We swear we're alive, but we're falling to pieces
We fight like lions, we howl at the moon
We should be flying instead we bury the truth
But I know inside we're beautiful creatures

We're beautiful creatures (beautiful)
We're beautiful creatures
We're beautiful creatures

===================


On the road through the dark night
You're on your own with no one to hear you
Going fast but it's alright
You're on your own with nothing to hold you back
And now you driven past the red light
Behind your shades all the colours seem faded
And now you're moving at the speed of light
I'll lead you home tonight

When you're tired of the dark nights
And need someone to hold
I'll be your fire in the cold rain
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you go

When you're tired of the dark nights
And need someone to hold
I'll be your fire in the cold rain
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you go

When you're tired of the dark nights
And need someone to hold
I'll be your fire in the cold rain
I'm never gonna let you go
(I'm never gonna let you go)
(I'm never gonna let you go)

===================


It's unavoidable
It just happens
And you grow up
Your heart dies

Who cares?
I care

===================


I can't listen to these stupid songs
'Cause they all remind me that you're gone
I'm still sleeping in your favorite tee
Pictures I just can't delete
Don't know how to be, how to be alone
If I can't live without you, I can't live at all
I'm sick of finding reasons to feel the way I did before

I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna wish that you would stay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?
I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna say I'm not okay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?

Why do I hold on to you?
Why do I hold on to you?

I'm still listening to this stupid song
Like I don't know where it all went wrong, mmm
All my friends are asking where you been
Memories keep on creeping in
Don't know how to be, how to be alone, hey

I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna wish that you would stay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?
I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna say I'm not okay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?

Hold on to you
Why do I hold on to you?
Why do I hold on to you?

Why, oh why do I lose my mind
When I hold on tight?
No, I don't wanna let go
Why, oh why do I lose my mind
When I hold on tight?
No, I don't wanna let go
Why, oh why do I lose my mind
When I hold on tight?
No, I don't wanna let go
(Don't wanna let go, don't wanna let go, don't wanna let go)
I don't wanna let go

I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna wish that you would stay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?
I don't wanna waste another day
I don't wanna say I'm not okay
If I know I should let go
Why do I hold on to you?

===================


Did I say something wrong? Did you hear what I was thinking?
Did I talk way too long when I told you all my feelings that night?
Is it you? Is it me? Did you find somebody better?
Someone who isn't me, 'cause I know that I was never your type
Never really your type

Overthinking's got me drinking
Messing with my head, whoa

Tell me what you hate about me
Whatever it is, I'm sorry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know I can be dramatic
But everybody said we had it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm coming to terms with a broken heart
I guess that sometimes good things fall apart

When you said it was real, guess I really did believe you
Did you fake how you feel when we parked down by the river that night? That night?
That night when we fogged up the windows in your best friend's car
'Cause we couldn't leave the windows down in December
Whoa

Tell me what you hate about me
Whatever it is, I'm sorry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know I can be dramatic
But everybody said we had it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm coming to terms with a broken heart
I guess that sometimes good things fall apart

Overthinking's got me drinking
Messing with my head, oh

Tell me what you hate about me (About me)
Whatever it is, I'm sorry (Oh, I'm sorry)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh, I'm sorry), yeah, yeah, yeah
I know I can be dramatic (I know I can be)
Everybody said we had it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm coming to terms with a broken heart
I guess that sometimes good things fall apart

===================


Flame still burns
Kerosene
Rise and fall
As I breathe

All these pictures on the screen
It's almost like they're real
And I think that I'd do anything
If it meant I didn't feel
What I feel
And I feel way too much
Truth is no one gives a fuck

That's why
I don't try
That's why
I stay high
I know that you're never gonna hear me
I know that these words'll go to waste
That's why
I don't try

Tried my best
Doors still closed
Love is deaf
For all I know

Sometimes it gets so hard
And I don't wanna fight
And everyday that passes by
Feels like it might
Be my last
And I feel way too much
Truth is no one gives a fuck

That's why
I don't try
That's why
I stay high
I know that you're never gonna hear me
I know that these words'll go to waste
That's why
I don't try

That's why
I don't try
That's why
I stay high

That's why
I don't try
That's why
I stay high
I know that you're never gonna hear me
I know that these words'll go to waste
That's why
I don't try

That's why
I don't try
That's why
I stay high

===================


We're blood
We're blood

'Cause when you find your mind in a dark place
Hold on, it won't be long
Before you see my face
I'm coming to the rescue
Take your hand, comfort you
It's the least that I can do

'Cause we're blood
Oh, we're blood
Oh, we're blood
Oh, we're blood

I heard you told your friends in the schoolyard
You were getting it tough, getting it hard
You know it nearly broke my heart
I'm coming to defend you
Live or die, see it through
It's the least that I can do

'Cause we're blood
Oh, we're blood
Oh, we're blood
Oh, we're blood

'Cause we're blood
Oh, we're blood
Oh, we're blood
Oh, we're blood
We're blood
Oh, we're blood
Oh, we're blood
Oh, we're blood

We're blood

===================


I didn't mean to hurt you when I hurt myself
It's just an empty lie screaming out for help
No, I didn't mean to scare you
But I couldn't see that when I went to hell
I was taking you with me

When I close my eyes
I'm climbing in the dark
Trying not to fall apart
Sometimes I get so high
Falling is the only out I see
And I don't wanna take you down with me
(You're only love in my heart, only love in my heart)
Take you down, take you down with me
(Down, take you down)
(Down, take you down)
(Down, take you down)
Down with me

This life is like a razor
When it cuts I bleed
But it's in my hand
And I'm doing it to me
Sometimes it's like an ocean
And it gets too deep
There's no way that now you could rescue me

When I close my eyes
I'm fighting in the dark
Trying not to break your heart
Sometimes I get so high
Falling is the only out I see
And I don't wanna take you down with me

You need to let it go now
Before you drown
I know that you won't understand
You need to let go of these hands
Cause I'm going now
And I don't wanna take you down with me

And I don't wanna take you down with me
Take you down, down with me

===================


You can go ahead and judge me
Just so you can say you're right
You can try to rise above me
But what's underneath is your own lies
You can choose to understand me
Or refuse to see the other side
Go and call me the enemy
While I'm only trying to save your life

When a war with each other
Is a war against ourselves
We both lose when we start the fight, oh no

No proof of God above me
I only know what I see
And we can only help ourselves
All together

All together
All together
All together
All together

You can try to separate us
Drop water with your mind
You can say that we are different
When we want the same to survive
When religion and leaders still remain in between us
We all lose if we can't align, oh no

No proof of God above me
I only know what I see
And we can only help ourselves
All together

All together
All together
All together
All together
We can only help ourselves

When a war with each other
Is a war against ourselves
We both lose when we start the fight, oh no

No proof of God above me
I only know what I see
And we can only help ourselves
All together

All together
All together
And we can only help ourselves
All together
All together
All together
All together
All together

===================


Intoxicating your kiss
Intoxicating your lips
No body does it like this
I find it hard to resist, oh-ooh
Feeling out of control, beautifully sold
What's coming over me?
It's a total eclipse of rationality

I don't usually say this
I don't usually play this game
Yeah, I know I'm not faded
But it kinda feels that way
I don't usually say this
But I think I should let you know
That baby, baby I don't, I don't wanna go

How could I go home
When I feel like I belong in your arms
It's like Champagne, feel it pouring in my veins
Yeah, I got myself too drunk on you to drive
So I'm crashing here tonight
(Ooh-ooh) Tonight (Ooh-ooh), tonight (Ooh-ooh)
Oh-oh, so I'm crashing here tonight

Hey, are you really this good?
Damn, are you really this good?
Baby, you're just like a drug
I'd bottle you up if I could, oh-ooh
Feeling out of control of your chemicals
What's coming over me?
It's a total eclipse of rationality

I don't usually say this
I don't usually play this game
Yeah, I know I'm not faded
But it kinda feels that way
I don't usually say this
But I think I should let you know
That baby, baby I don't, I don't wanna go

How could I go home
When I feel like I belong in your arms
It's like Champagne, feel it pouring in my veins
Yeah, I got myself too drunk on you to drive
So I'm crashing here tonight
(Ooh-ooh) Tonight (Ooh-ooh), tonight (Ooh-ooh)
Oh-oh, so I'm crashing here tonight

How could I go home
When you're all I wanna know?
Come on, let me see your bed
It's too late for this to end
Yeah, I got myself too drunk on you to drive
So I'm crashing here tonight

How could I go home
When I feel like I belong in your arms
It's like Champagne, feel it pouring in my veins
Yeah, I got myself too drunk on you to drive
So I'm crashing here tonight
(Ooh-ooh) Tonight (Ooh-ooh), yeah I'm crashing here tonight (Ooh-ooh)
Oh-oh, so I'm crashing here tonight

===================


I know the way the story goes
The first part is the fun
We leave the room a little cold
To keep each other warm

Just for a minute
'Fore the bombs are hitting
And every night it turns to war

Thought we had a vision
Don't know what I see in us
No more

Cause we're halfway broken
Tryna make up
Damage already done

And it's only
One way down
Guess now we'll join the club

'Cause everyone falls so hard
And everything falls apart

But we know we
Still got heart
Here's to the broken ones

Here's to the broken ones
Broken
Here's to the broken ones

I used to know your breathing sounds
You'd sound me off to sleep
Oh, we're just lying quiet now
Both wide awake

But dreaming of that minute
'Fore the bombs were hitting
And every night it turns to war

Thought we had a vision
Don't know what I see in us
No more

Cause we're halfway broken
Tryna make up
Damage already done

And it's only
One way down
Guess now we'll join the club

'Cause everyone falls so hard
And everything falls apart

But we know we
Still got heart
Here's to the broken ones
Here's to the broken ones
Here's to the broken ones
Here's to the broken ones
Here's to the broken ones
Here's to the broken ones
Here's to the broken ones

===================


Your energy holds on to me
Still wrapped up in your strings
Those words you speak
They cut so deep
I still feel everything

I am not your enemy
So why do we keep fighting?
I am not your enemy
So why are you still trying

To take me down
When every piece of me is underground
To break me down
When every piece of me still needs you now

I see your pain, it's on your face
You're talking through your teeth
Can't rearrange my will to stay
And you make it hurt the worst 'cause you know me

I am not your enemy
So why do we keep fighting?
I am not your enemy
So why are you still trying

To take me down
When every piece of me is underground
To break me down
When every piece of me still needs you now

===================


Told me I shouldn't watch
Got in your car, then we were nothing
All the nights in your room, shit we got through
Left in your dust, yeah
Don't know what you got, but I thought we had it
Now I'm supposed to act like it doesn't matter
But I'm writing it down, getting it out
Here's to me hoping

Someday I'll come home
And feel like no one's even gone
Play this at my shows
And know that I've been moving on
Someday I'll go to bed and I'll forget I'm lyin' in your spot
But until some day comes
I'll be writing sad songs

Wish that there was a way I could have saved
One little moment, yeah
Pull it out when I can, handle the pain
And know when it's over
I was so intact on the night I met you
Now I'm making sad songs inside my bedroom
But I'm writing it down, getting it out
Here's to me hoping

Some day I'll come home
And feel like no one's even gone
Play this at my shows
And know that I've been moving on
Some day I'll go to bed and I'll forget I'm lyin' in your spot
But until some day comes
I'll be writing sad songs

Hoo, hoo
I'll be writing sad songs
Hoo, hoo
I'll be writing sad songs
Hoo, hoo
I'll be writing sad songs (Sad songs)
Hoo, hoo
I'll be writing sad songs

I'll be writing sad songs

Someday I'll come home
And feel like no one's even gone
Play this at my shows
And know that I've been moving on
Someday I'll go to bed and I'll forget I'm lyin' in your spot
But until some day comes
I'll be writing sad songs

===================


Lay my soul out bear by the river, mmm
Let my bridges burn and deliver me, mmm
Bring my soul back from the rhythm
Of the chains that got me here
It ain't fair, no, it ain't, mmm

Mercy, mercy, mercy
I've no luck with the man upstairs
Help me, help me, help me

Won't you pray?
'Cause she don't hear me like she hears you pray
So just pray for me
Won't you pray?
'Cause I'm too far from heaven when I pray
So just pray for me

Oh, won't you, won't you pray for me?
Oh, won't you, won't you pray for me?
Oh, won't you, won't you pray for me?
Oh, won't you, won't you pray for me?

Mercy, mercy, mercy
Help me, help me, help me
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Help me, help me, help me
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Help me, help me, help me
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Help me, help me, help me

Help me, help me
Help me, help me

(Help me, help me)
Help me, help me
(Help me, help me)

Won't you pray?
'She don't hear me like she hears you pray
So just pray for me
Won't you pray?
'Cause I'm too far from heaven when I pray
So just pray for me

Oh, won't you, won't you pray for me?
Oh, won't you, won't you pray for me?
Oh, won't you, won't you pray for me?
Oh, won't you, won't you pray for me?

Never seen Mona Lisa up close
But I've seen perfection under your clothes
Yeah, we fell in love and we built a home
Though we may never see the streets of Rome

And I hope it's okay
'Cause the unknown is on its way

If I died in your arms, that's right where I'm supposed to be
You know I'm not afraid as long as you're next to me
So tell me, will you hold me when the curtains close?
If I died in your arms, that's right where I'm supposed to be

Yeah we may never sleep under Northern Lights
But I've seen the stars flicker in your eyes

And I hope it's okay (It's okay)
Cause the unknown is on its way

If I died in your arms, that's right where I'm supposed to be
You know I'm not afraid as long as you're next to me
So tell me, will you hold me when the curtains close?
If I died in your arms, that's right where I'm supposed to be

(It's okay, it's okay)
If I died in your arms, that's right where I'm supposed to be
(It's okay)
(It's okay)

Lay me down in the ground by my hometown, girl
We, we never leave, but it feels like we've seen the whole world
A thousand cheers when the tears on your parents' roof
Forget my fears every time that I'm under you
All along, all I needed was you
So I swear, I'm not scared when it's over

If I died in your arms, that's right where I'm supposed to be
You know I'm not afraid as long as you're next to me
So tell me, will you hold me when the curtains close?
If I died in your arms, that's right where I'm supposed to be

===================


Jumpin' right off the edge
Freedom, it's freedom
Wouldn't do it for less
Then freedom, freedom

I was sleeping, divin'
Eyes closed, blinded
Now for the first time
I can see

Sometimes I gotta pinch myself
Oh, gorgeous
Hello today
Well let me introduce myself
Oh, gorgeous

All those days that passed me by
I can't believe I'm still alive

They say you need the dark to shine
It's like I can see for the first time
And it's gorgeous
(It's gorgeous, go-ohhh)
(It's gorgeous, go-ohhh)

I can see it for miles
Freedom, I can feel it
No more living denial
See it, breathe it

Sometimes I gotta pinch myself
Oh, gorgeous
Hello today
Well let me introduce myself
Oh, gorgeous

All those days that passed me by
I can't believe I'm still alive

They say you need the dark to shine
It's like I can see for the first time
And it's gorgeous
(It's gorgeous, go-ohhh)
(It's gorgeous, go-ohhh)

===================


If I asked you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet
But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable
Known someone that could level you with her eyes
Feelin' like God put an angel on Earth just for you
Who could rescue you from the depths of Hell
And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel
You don't know about real loss
'Cause that only occurs when you love something more than you love yourself
I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much

===================


Won't you let me love the lonely
Out of you, out of you?
Won't you let me love the lonely
Out of you, out of you?

If you only loved yourself
Don't take it out on someone else, oh, oh
If you knew what love was worth
It'd bring your head back down to earth, oh, oh

Won't you let me love the lonely
Out of you, out of you?
Won't you let me love the lonely
Out of you, out of you?

You used to touch me like you never felt a thing
I was talking to myself when I thought you were listening
You could've left before, was it fun watching me bleed?
Were you taking your time when you left your scars on me?

Won't you let me love the lonely
Out of you, out of you?
Won't you let me love the lonely
Out of you, out of you?

Won't you let me love the lonely
Out of you, out of you?
Won't you let me love the lonely
Out of you, out of you?

===================


It was only a dream
The waves of evil crashing over us
It was only a weak and fateful scream beneath the battlements
But I know it's hard
But follow before it's too dark
Wake up, my love
Please don't give up on me

I know it's hard
Wake up, my love
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me, on me, on me, on me
Don't give up on

Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me

It was only a dream
The waves of evil crashing over us
It was only a weak and fateful scream beneath the battlements
But I know it's hard
But follow before it's too dark
Wake up, my love
Please don't give up on me

Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me, on me, on me, on me
Give up on me

Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me, on me, on me, on me
Don't give up on

If there's a God
Why'd He make me?
All of these flaws
Is all that I see
If there's a God
I don't believe
Someone as perfect as you would love me
God (Damnit)

Praying to a ghost
Hoping he gets it
The last three girls I fucked didn't listen
The last two pills I took haven't kicked in
Having these one night stands with an addiction
Now I gotta catch a red eye to Michigan
Playing a show, then a girl that I'm getting with
Fuck it, I'm young, I can act like an idiot
How many sins I gotta make till I get the hint

But shit, it's 4am
Pouring rain out
Bored again
So I break down
Go and send
More than "hey" now, now
I fucked up
Of course I did
The more I think now
I should quit
Forfeit the crown
I'd give this up
To not let you down again

If there's a God
Why'd He make me?
All of these flaws
Is all that I see
If there's a God
I don't believe
Someone as perfect as you would love me
God (Damnit)

God (Damnit)
God (Damnit)
God, why me?
God (Damnit)
God (Damnit)
God (Damnit)
God, why me?
God (Damnit)

Baby you're a ghost, why are you missing
Maybe cuz I haven't hit you back in a minute
Maybe cuz I flirt with every girl in existence
I blame it on distance that I'm being distant
But I don't fucking care, I gotta sing to these kids quick
I remember never having fans that would listen
But now I gotta thousand every city I visit
It's just you ain't here now and I miss it

But shit, it's 4am
Pouring rain out
Bored again
So I break down
Go and send
More than "hey" now, now
I fucked up
Of course I did
The more I think now
I should quit
Forfeit the crown
I'd give this up
To not let you down again

If there's a God
Why'd He make me?
All of these flaws

===================


Two choices on my mind
Four hours on the road
Give way to control
Go around it a thousand times
I'm holding on too tight
Let it go and feel the ride

Is it stupid that I love you?
When I never felt so awake
Was it all just a big mistake?
Do I wanna let it happen?
Do you wanna just walk away?
When you feel like my soul mate

But it's all gold
And it's so good
But it's all gold
And it's so good

Is it stupid that I love you?
Was it all a big mistake?
Do I wanna let it happen?
Do you wanna just walk away?

Is it stupid that I love you?
Is it stupid that I love you?
Is it stupid that I love you, love you, love you, love, love, love...
Is it stupid that I love you?

Was it.. all all all
Is it stupid that I love you?
Was it.. all all all

Staring hard at the future
Only close my eyes to blink
This is my sanctuary
This is my place to think
I'm driving 'til I find
What I've been looking for
But it's inside

Do I walk on the cut glass?
Do I run to the forest?
Do I stand in the fire?
Or do I hide from this moment?
Do I let someone else take the fall
'Cause I'm scared that I'll lose it all

But it's all gold
And it's so good
You gotta work for it, work for it
Work for it, work for it
And so you should
Oh oh, oh

Was it.. all all all
Is it stupid that I love you?
Was it.. all all all

Is it stupid that I love you?
Was it all a big mistake?
Do I wanna let it happen?
Do you wanna just walk away?

===================


No, don't come find me
I won't be here waiting
I so can do it alone
You're not worth staying

Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?

No, don't come find me
I won't be here waiting
I so can do it alone
You're not worth staying

Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?

===================

We could hide away in daylight
We go undercover, wait out the sun
Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty, that’s where we run

Everyday people do everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now, we are a different kind
We can do anything

We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be

Anybody’s got the power
They don't see it cause they don't understand
Spin around and round for hours
You and me, we got the world in our hands

Everyday people do everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now, we are a different kind
We can do anything

We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes, me and you
We could be

We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you...
We could be

All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light
(We could be)
All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light

We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you...
We could be

I saw stars on the pavement
California dreams
Looked up through the bright lights
No stars that I see

You said, "It’s all yours if you take it there."
I said, "I can’t do it alone, I swear."
You said, "It’s all yours,
It’s all yours when you smile."

It’s only you
Who loves me like you do
Trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it
Acting like a fool
Wanna scream it from the roof
I’m trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it (about it)

Before you, love, I was lost
Drifting at sea
You were the beacon I’d followed home
You were the one who rescued me

You said, "It’s all yours if you take it there."
I said, "I can’t do it alone, I swear."
You said, "It’s all yours,
It’s all yours when you smile."

It’s only you
Loves me like you do
Trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it
Acting like a fool
Wanna scream it from the roof
I’m trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it (about it)

You said, "Oh, whoa.
I won’t lose you, no, whoa."

It’s only you
Loves me like you do
Trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it
Acting like a fool
Wanna scream it from the roof
I’m trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it (about it)

[Ryan Tedder:]
I think scars are beautiful, I think black is white
I'm stuck between the Hell I'm in and where we lay
You say that this could kill you, your words cut like a knife
We are the beautiful mistake that I can't find

[Chorus - Ryan Tedder:]
So I, I, I don't care if it kills me tonight
Cause I, I, I'll be loving these scars for life!
And I, I, I don't care if it kills me tonight
Cause I, I, I, I'll be loving these scars for life!

[Ryan Tedder:]
I think that we are chemicals, I think the dark is light
And I know each and every wrong you right
You say that this could kill you, your words cut like a knife
And we are the beautiful mistake that I can't find

[Chorus x2]

===================


We drive so far, to get away
Never look back, we don't care about nothin' else
A sweet escape
Gotta break free, like a shooting star
Let the skyline guide us
We don't care about nothin' else
A sweet escape
Feels like heaven, nothing can stop us now
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can hold us down 
Just like a wave that never breaks
Nothing can stop us now
And if you fall, I'll pick you up
I'll follow you 'til the end of time
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can stop us now [x4]

All lights go out and fade away
Never lose faith, leave all of your fears behind
A sweet escape
Gotta break free, with an open heart
Let the sunshine find us
We don't care about nothin' else
A sweet escape
Feels like heaven, nothing can stop us now
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can hold us down 
Just like a wave that never breaks
Nothing can stop us now
And if you fall, I'll pick you up
I'll follow you 'til the end of time
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can stop us now [x4]

And if you fall, I'll pick you up
I'll follow you 'til the end of time
We run away, a sweet escape
Nothing can stop us now

===================


I was alone
I was made of stone
You took me home
We've built a world, a world for us
We flew like birds, a new beginning

It's better (better, better), you keeping me together (—gether—gether)
You know that I will never (never, ever) try to pull you down, down
Lover (lover lover), you can always be here, I'll take cover
You know that I will never (never, ever) leave you all alone

I'd be nothing if it wasn't for you
If it wasn't for you

I was a fool
Always keeping a distance
If I'd ever known,
You found a way
I thought I'd always stay the same
Because of you, I saw a new beginning

It's better (better, better), you keeping me together (—gether—gether)
You know that I will never (never, ever) try to pull you down, down
Lover (lover, lover), you can always be here, I'll take cover
You know that I will never (never, ever) leave you all alone

I'd be nothing if it wasn't for you
If it wasn't for you
[2x]

===================


Catch you eye in the night, it's glowing
I'm so high and there's no controlling
In the light of the moon you're all I see
Smokey air in your skin is glossy
Cloudy minds acting like we've lost it
I'm possessed like a drug you're all I need

[Chorus:]
Cause you are burning, burning this heart of mine
You're burning, right through my veins tonight
You're in my blood
You're in my blood
You're in my blood

Shaky hands and the blood is rushing
Skin to skin and our lips are touching
As we move like a dance, just flawlessly
And your breath makes it sound like music
Round and round as the walls are moving
You become what I am, you're what I bleed

[Chorus x2]

===================


I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you'll never know

When the daylight comes you feel so cold,
You know
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go

Waiting for the fire to light
Feeling like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control

We're under control

I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you'll never know

When the daylight comes you feel so cold,
You know
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go

Waiting for the fire to light
Feeling like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control

Waiting for the fire to light
Feeling like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control

We're under control

===================


Walking down town like a fallen urban angel
Every street could be home, it's plain to see
Mama said trust yourself long before you trust a stranger
But she's a long way from home, her destiny

[Chorus:]
All this love, all this love, all this love
Do me right, do me wrong,
Do me in, you should know, that I'll be okay
(All this love)
Like a drug I'm not wasting away, if you wonder, I'll be okay
(All this love)
She said I wanna live, I don't wanna die young
I'm a live through the night, just to light up the sun
I don't need to hide, I don't need to run.

All this love
All this love

Been a long day, been a long night in the city
How does it feel to sleep out in the cold?
Mama said don't be scared, even in the face of danger
I don't need much, I got all I need to owe.

[Chorus:]
All this love, all this love, all this love
Do me right, do me wrong,
Do me in, you should know, that I'll be okay
(All this love)
Like a drug I'm no wasting away, if you wonder, I'll be okay
(All this love)
She said I wanna live, I don't wanna die young
I'm a live through the night, just to light up the sun
I don't need to hide, I don't need to run.

All this love
All this love
All this love
All this love

===================


I stared up at the sun
Thought of all of the people, places and things I’ve loved
I stared up just to see
With all of the faces, you were the one next to me

[Pre-Chorus:]
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out of the window tonight

[Chorus:]
If I lose myself tonight
It’ll be by your side
I lose myself tonight...
(oh) yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lose myself tonight
It’ll be you and I
Lose myself tonight...

I stared up at the sun
Thought of all of the people, places and things I’ve loved
I stared up just to see
With all of the faces, you were the one next to me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Take us down and we keep trying
Forty thousand feet, keep flying
Take us down and we keep trying
Forty thousand feet, keep flying
Take us down and we keep trying
Forty thousand feet, keep flying
Take us down and we keep trying
Forty thousand feet, keep flying
(Lose myself)
If I lose myself tonight...

===================


The sun hits like a bullet of faith
And then suddenly I'm wide awake
Fake bliss, our apologies made
Was an enemy with no escape
My hands were tied
But now they're mine
So grab on to desire and run away

These will be the years
These will be the years
The lights will all appear
These will be the years

Years
These will be the years
Years

Grey dust now sparkling gold and the best is yet to unfold
White heat found in comfort and cold and a heart was found in her soul
Her hands were tied
But now they're mine
So grab on and where ever you'll go I'll go

These will be the years
These will be the years
The lights will all appear
These will be the years
Years
These will be the years

These will be the years
These will be the years
The lights will all appear
These will be the years

===================


See the smoke when the sun shines
We will forever be faded under gold skies
Captivated in your cold eyes
We will forever be faded under gold skies

See the smoke when the sun shines
We will forever be faded under gold skies
Captivated in your cold eyes
We will forever be faded under gold skies

Coming up, coming down, look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever
Coming up, coming down, look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever
Coming up, coming down, look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever
Coming up, coming down, look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever

Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up

We will forever be faded under gold skies

See the smoke when the sun shines
We will forever be faded under gold skies
Captivated in your cold eyes
We will forever be faded under gold skies

Coming up, coming down, look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever
Coming up, coming down, look at all this love we found
Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever

Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up

Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up
Coming up, coming up

We will forever be faded under gold skies
We will forever be faded under gold skies
We will forever be faded under gold skies
We will forever be faded under gold skies

===================


These days nothing ever feels like home
You say you're driving down a one way road
If you see the day only for the night
Do you see the darkness in the middle of the light?
Feel your heart break
You're not the only one you know

When you find yourself, all on your own
You'll never walk alone
In the dead of the night, out in the cold
You'll never walk alone

You'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

===================


Remember we were staring up to those peaks on the horizon?
You told me if I faced my fears, there was no doubt I could climb them

There's nothing I have wanted more
The only one I've been waiting for
So hold your breath and close your eyes
The night is cold but the sun will rise

Counting down to the light, through the night
Just waiting for tomorrow
Almost there, almost time
All my life, just waiting
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more, waiting for tomorrow

Just waiting for tomorrow

Fear is creeping up behind as this road is finally ending
I can't find order in my mind but this noise inside so deafening

There's nothing I have wanted more
The only one I've been waiting for
So hold your breath and close your eyes
The night is cold but the sun will rise

Counting down to the light, through the night
Just waiting for tomorrow
Almost there, almost time
All my life, just waiting
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more, waiting for tomorrow

Just waiting
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more, waiting for tomorrow
Waiting for tomorrow
Waiting for tomorrow

Waiting for tomorrow

===================


I'm on the edge got to get away
I've seen it all before
I'm going down like a renegade
And I'm still begging from more

This is the last time I tell you to open your eyes
The city is sleepin, the monsters outside
The fire is burnin', there's no where to hide
And I won't say it anymore

Break through the silence
I can feel the energy rising
Turn up the sirens
We were never meant to be quiet

Break through the silence
I can feel the energy rising
Turn up the sirens
We were never meant to be quiet

There are lights that'll lead away
To what we searching for
A million miles from yesterday
And it's right here on the floor

This is the last time I tell you to open your eyes
The city is sleepin, the monsters outside
The fire is burnin' there's no way to hide
And I won't say it anymore

Break through the silence
I can feel the energy rising
Turn up the sirens
We were never meant to be quiet

Break through the silence
I can feel the energy rising
Turn up the sirens
We were never meant to be quiet

===================


Flash fire, I'm coming for ya
You're gonna feel me like the summer, like the sun in your eyes
Hold tight, another minute
Another hour, baby, Imma' show you

You can rely on me
I'll give you all you need
In a smoke cloud, tryna find ground
In the place where we belong

We don't have to dream to make it beautiful
Baby, everything we do is beautiful
We can light a fire, watch it everglow
We won't burn out, we won't burn out
We won't burn out, we won't burn out

We won't burn out, we won't burn out

Won't take a million dollars
For us to have the kind of life you only see in a dream
Wake up, 'cause now you're in it
I wanna show you all the magic in the air

And tonight it's free
It will be all you need
In a smoke cloud, tryna find ground
In a place where we belong

We don't have to dream to make it beautiful
Baby, everything we do is beautiful
We can light a fire, watch it everglow
We won't burn out, we won't burn out
We won't burn out, we won't burn out
We won't burn out, we won't burn out

We won't burn out, we won't burn out

===================


Is your head spinning?
Is your heart racing?
Is there fire in your veins?
Are your bones burning?
Is your skin yearning?
Cause you're driving me insane

I kinda feel like I, feel like I saw the light
You got me way up, a thousand miles
Can we stay right here in this atmosphere
Like we're flying out in space?

Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground
Don't look down
See that sky, we're gonna reach it now

Do you feel the lightning inside of you?
Will you follow through if I fall for you?
Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground

[Beat break]

Oh oh oooh

Oh oh oooh oh, Oh oh oooh oh
Oh oh oooh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oooh oh, Oh oh oooh oh
Oh oh oooh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Are your hands shaking?
Are your fists breaking?
Are you climbing over walls?
Are the times changing?
Is the noise fading?
Cause I wanna get it out

Oh

I kinda feel like I, feel like I saw the light
You got me way up, a thousand miles
Can we stay right here in this atmosphere
Or are you afraid to fall?

Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground
Don't look down
See that sky, we're gonna reach it now
Do you feel the lightning inside of you?
Will you follow through if I fall for you?
Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground

Oh oh oooh oh, Oh oh oooh oh
Oh oh oooh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oooh oh, Oh oh oooh oh
Oh oh oooh oh, oh oh

Don't look down

Do you feel the lightning inside of you?
Will you follow through if I fall for you?
Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground

I'm a dreamer
Don't tell me not to dream
I got freedom
And that's everything to me
It don't matter
What I've got or where I go
I'll find shelter a million miles from home
It ain't easy to keep going when it's hard
Keep shining in the dark
When you wanna fall apart
But I'm a dreamer
So don't tell me not to dream
I'm a believer

As long as I got something to believe in
As long as I got something to believe in
As long as I got something to believe in
As long as I got something to believe in
As long as I got something to believe in

I'm a lover
Don't tell me who to love
I'm a runner
'Cause I've got somewhere to run
I just listen to the voices in my head
When they tell me
I'll always have something to believe in

As long as I got something to believe in
As long as I got something to believe in
As long as I got something to believe in
As long as I got something to believe in

You got to believe
Hey hey
You got to believe
You know you got to believe
You got to believe
I got to believe
You got to believe in
You got to believe
You got to believe
You got to believe
Ooh yeah
You got to believe
Hey hey
You got to believe in
Come on
Oh, you got to, we got to, she got to, he got to
You got to believe
You got to believe
You got to believe in
Hey hey
You got to believe
In the morning, in the evening
You got to believe
Late at night to go
You got to believe
You got to believe
You got to believe in
Oh yeah

I don't believe
I don't believe
You got to believe

===================


Killed the demons of my mind
Ever since you came around
We're a river, running wild
How could I have been so blind?

I just live a fast life
Forget about the past time
I'm numb out to escape my feels
And friendships only pass by
Show up, gone, like strobe lights
But with you I feel something real

And I'd walk a million miles just to see your smile
Till the day I die
Oh, I need you by my side, we get high on life
Till the day we die
High on life till the day we die
High on life till the day we die
High on life till the day we die
And I'd walk a million miles, just to see your smile
Till the day I die

High on life till the day we die

Through my fingers, out of sight
How could I have let you go?
Cutting corners, turning stones
But I can only see your ghost

I just live a fast life
Forget about the past time
Numb up to escape my feels
And friendships only passed by
The show and calling strobe lights
With you I feel something real

And I'd walk a million miles just to see your smile
Till the day I die
Oh, I need you by my side, we'd get high on life
Till the day we die

High on life till the day we die
Oh, I need you by my side, we'd get high on life
Till the day we die
High on life till the day we die

And I'd walk a million miles just to see your smile
Till the day I die
Oh, I need you by my side, we'd get high on life
Till the day we die

===================


I thought my heart was gone
After I lost it all
Felt I was falling down
Still I chose to be proud
Until I hit the ground

You got me back on my feet again
You said that lovers come and may go
You said that time will pass but I'll stay your friend
I'll help you up when you feel alone

I was lonely
But after all you told me I'd be okay
Cause friends are worth a whole lot more than money
Hope that everyone has felt like me
Hold on and believe

I was lonely
But after all you told me I'd be okay
Cause friends are worth a whole lot more than money
Hope that everyone has felt like me
Hold on and believe

I started looking back
At all I used to have
I never felt so low
Where did everyone go
When I need them most

You got me back on my feet again
You said that lovers come and may go
You said that time will pass but I'll stay your friend
I'll help you up when you feel alone

I was lonely
But after all you told me I'd be okay
Cause friends are worth a whole lot more than money
Hope that everyone has felt like me
Hold on and believe

I was lonely
But after all you told me I'd be okay
Cause friends are worth a whole lot more than money
Hope that everyone has felt like me
Hold on and believe

===================


Oh, I was hiding from the pain
But now I'm tired of running
Felt like the gods forgot my name

In my head
I didn't know what I was looking for
We got so close to something beautiful
And now I'm never gonna let you go
You go, you go

Home, take me home
Back to my roots, yeah it's been so long
Hey, I found a way
Back to the streets where they know my name

You know I been all around, all around
But you were always on my mind, on my mind
Home, take me home
Back to my roots, yeah it's been so long, yeah

Home, take me home
Back to my roots, yeah it's been so long, yeah

Oh, I was falling from my high
And I came down to nothing
Feels like the gods left me behind

In my head
I didn't know what I was looking for
We got so close to something beautiful
And now I'm never gonna let you go
You go, you go

Home, take me home
Back to my roots, yeah it's been so long
Hey, I found a way
Back to the streets where they know my name

You know I been all around, all around
But you were always on my mind, on my mind
Home, take me home
Back to my roots, yeah it's been so long, yeah

(Been so long, been so long)
(Been so long, long, long)
(Been so long, been so long)
(Been so long, long, long)

Home, take me home
Back to my roots, yeah it's been so long, yeah

===================


If I told you this was only gonna hurt
If I warned you that the fire's gonna burn
Would you walk in? Would you let me do it first?
Do it all in the name of love
Would you let me lead you even when you're blind?
In the darkness, in the middle of the night
In the silence, when there's no one by your side
Would you call in the name of love?

In the name of love, name of love
In the name of love, name of love

In the name of
Love
In the name, name
Love
In the name, name
Love

If I told you we could bathe in all the lights
Would you rise up, come and meet me in the sky?
Would you trust me when you're jumping from the heights?
Would you fall in the name of love?
When there's madness, when there's poison in your head
When the sadness leaves you broken in your bed
I will hold you in the depths of your despair
And it's all in the name of love

In the name of love, name of love
In the name of love, name of love

In the name of
Love
In the name, name
Love
In the name, name
Love

I wanna testify
Scream in the holy light
You bring me back to life
And it's all in the name of love
I wanna testify
Scream in the holy light
You bring me back to life
And it's all in the name of love

In the name of love, name of love
In the name of love, name of love

In the name of
Love
In the name, name
Love
In the name, name
Love
In the name of
Love
In the name, name
Love
In the name of
Love
In the name of
Love
In the name of
Love

Looking out for a new horizon
Reaching out I can almost see the place
Holding on with the heart that's frozen
In the dark, but I am not afraid
No, I am not afraid

We'll be free, but I don't know where we're going
You and me this is our life and we own it
Like lions in the wild
Like lions in the wild
Like lions in the wild

Looking out at the open skyline
Reaching out I can almost touch the place
Where the lost ones find their freedom
In the dark but I am not afraid
No, I am not afraid

We'll be free, but I don't know where we're going
You and me this is our life and we own it
Like lions in the wild
Like lions in the wild
Like lions in the wild

Like lions in the wild
Like lions in the wild

===================


Oh, we've been at it for so so long
And you, keep telling me that I'm wrong
And your eyes only see what they want to see
But now you're blinded when I leave

And all I see is now
I am, Mistaken
This time, I am sure

Love, oh, mistaken
I am sure
I am sure
I am sure

Oh, I've been waiting for the day
The things, will never ever be the same
Not down, cause we are at the end of it
They lie, and again we are asleep

And all I see is now
I am, mistaken
This time, I am sure

Love, oh, stranded
I am sure
I am sure
I am sure

===================


Summer nights all align
As we drown in the moonlight
We collide in plain sight
Yeah, I know we'll be alright

And we come alive, we run the night with strangers
'Cause in the end, we're all familiar faces
We're young and wild, enjoy the ride, we made it
We made it

I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
Say you'll never leave
Because I love the feeling, I love the feeling
Find myself awake at night
See you through my lucid eyes
Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

Wide awake, no time to waste
Make a mark on my timeline
We're safe and sound, we come around
We are dancing, the sun down

And we come alive, we run the night with strangers
'Cause in the end, we're all familiar faces
We're young and wild, enjoy the ride, we made it
We made it

I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming
Say you'll never leave
Because I love the feeling, I love the feeling
Find myself awake at night
See you through my lucid eyes
Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

Oh, I don't need no sleep
'Cause I'm already dreaming, already dreaming

Flashback to the time in your life
When you thought it would be easy
But it's hard when you're take on the world alone

The one shot that you fire at the sky
Hoping someone else can see it
Just a sign that you're not out there on your own

We come one tonight
I've been waiting for your wake up call
Growing stronger now
I can hear it in a thunderstorm

We sing, oh oh oh oh oh
I don't want to do this without you
Oh oh oh oh oh
I won't let go now that I've found you
Now that I've found you
Oh oh oh oh oh
I won't let go now that I've found you
Oh oh oh oh oh
I won't let go now that I've found you
Now that I've found you

Some say you can never go back
To the city built for dreamers
But I know we can find it on our own

The one shot that we fire at the sky
But this time we are together
We're right here in this moment where we belong

We come one tonight
I've been waiting for your wake up call
Growing stronger now
I can hear it in a thunderstorm

We sing, oh oh oh oh oh
I don't want to do this without you
Oh oh oh oh oh
I won't let go now that I've found you
Now that I've found you
Now that I've found you
Oh oh oh oh oh
I won't let go now that I've found you
Now that I've found you

Tell me what you're crying for
I'll wipe your tears, oh love
If your soul is aching love
I will comfort you for sure

If we're caught in a wave, I will carry you over
It don't matter where you are, I'll run to your front door
When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm a hundred with you

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart

Love, between our love
Love, between our love

Shadows play on idle hands
I lose myself, I do
But I find my way to velvet sands
I'll crash right into you

If we're caught in a wave, I will carry you over
It don't matter where we are, you're still the one I choose
When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm a hundred with you

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up (run it up)
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave (in a wave)
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart

Love, between our love
Love, between our love

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up (run it up)
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart

Rewind, repeat it

Stay for the night
Call it what you want
And I'll compromise
To have you in my arms
Is this what you needed?
'Cause I'll find the faith in anything
Don't fight the feeling
Rewind, repeat it

Rewind repeat it

If the world ends tonight
You'll be in my arms
We'll be frozen in time
Underneath the stars
My lungs are screaming
This heart is bleeding
I love this feeling
So rewind, repeat it

Rewind, repeat it

Just close your eyes
All you need to see
Is your heart and mine
Underneath the sheets
Don't fight your demons
'Cause they will tear you apart from the seams
And if the darkness creeps in
Rewind, repeat it
Rewind, repeat it

If the world ends tonight
You'll be in my arms
We'll be frozen in time
Underneath the stars
My lungs are screaming
This heart is bleeding
I love this feeling
So rewind, repeat it

Rewind, repeat it

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better

Now we're picking fights
And slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why
Wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies?
Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody
Just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

All the messed up fights
And slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why
Wonder what for
It's like we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies?
Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody
Just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Scared to be lonely

Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely
Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely

Is it just our bodies?
Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely
Eh, eh, scared to be lonely

Light 'em up, light 'em up
Tell me where you are, tell me where you are
Summer nights, bright lights
And the shooting stars, they break my heart

Calling you now, but you're not picking up
Shadows so close if that's still enough
Light a match, light a match
Baby, in the dark, show me where you are

Oh, love
How I miss you every single day
When I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away

So far away

It's breaking me, I'm losing you
We were far from perfect
But we were worth it
Too many fights, and we cried
But never said we're sorry
Stop saying you love me

You're calling me now, but I can't pick up
Your shadow's still close, and I'm still in love
The summer's over now
But somehow it still breaks my heart
We could have had the stars
Oh

Oh, love
How I miss you every single day
When I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away

So far away
So far away, oh
So far away
So far away

[Romy Dya:]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day
When I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day when you're so far away

(I got this feeling on a summer day)
(Knew it when I saw her face)
(I just thought that)
(She could be the one)

She looks good in the morning
And she don't even know it
I don't want you to go yet
Can we stay in the moment?

Don't look in the mirror, look into my eyes
When you see your reflection, you'll see what I like
You look good in the morning
And you don't even know it
I knew that

I got this feeling on a summer day
Knew it when I saw her face
I just thought that
She could be the one
I got this feeling on a summer day
Knew it when I saw her face
I just thought that
She could be the one 
(That she could be)

[Macklemore:]
Sundress with you on my arm
Take the coupe out the garage
Pull the roof back, just me, you and the stars
Toast to the Gods
She's the one, a masterpiece
She a drug, got a fast release
Got me sprung, wrapped in sheets
Wake up, fuck, and then we going back to sleep

Me and you on an island
With the ocean color stuck in your iris
We're comfortable in silence
But I prefer when we wilding
Sundress, nothing underneath
As we undress, you could look in my eyes
See I'm some mess, couple of broken people
Trying to complete each other under one breath

Don't look in the mirror, look into my eyes
When you see your reflection you'll see what I like
You look good in the morning
And you don't even know it
I knew that

I got this feeling on a summer day
Knew it when I saw her face
I just thought that
She could be the one
I got this feeling on a summer day
Knew it when I saw her face
I just thought that
She could be the one 
(That she could be)

She could be the one

===================


Is this life
Is it real
Do you feel the things that I feel
Close your eyes
Disappear
And we can watch burn, burn from here

'Cause I'm rising higher than I've been before
And I'm ready, ready crying out for more
'Cause I know the sun is never going down 
Nothing's gonna slow us down
I don't wanna fall asleep
Baby stay awake with me
The sun is never going
Sun is never going
Sun is never going down, down, down

Blinding lights, in a daze
Let it stay like this for always
My whole sky, is a blaze
And when you’re here with me we elevate

'Cause I'm rising higher than I've been before
And I'm ready, ready crying out for more
'Cause I know the sun is never going down 
Nothing's gonna slow us down 
I don't wanna fall asleep
Baby stay awake with me
The sun is never going
Sun is never going
Sun is never going down, down, down

===================


I woke up pissed off today,
And lately everyone feels fake
Somewhere, I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

Last year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you

I got you, I promise
But let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

Boy, I'm holding on to something
Won't let go of you for nothing
I'm running, running just to keep my hands on you
There was a time that I was so blue
What I got to do to show you?
I'm running, running just to keep my hands on you

Running, running just to keep my hands on you
Running, running just to keep my hands on you
So, I'm running, running just to keep my hands on you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

===================


When life gets you down
We find a way to make it better
When days turn into dark
That's when we light it up together

These are the times that we've been praying for
These are the moments that we will not forget
This is the life that we've been waiting for
I wouldn't change it for nothing

These are the times that we've been praying for
These are the moments that we will not forget
This is the life that we've been waiting for
I wouldn't change it for nothing

Now that it's clear
We made it through the rain together
It feels like home so why don't we just stay forever

These are the times that we've been praying for
These are the moments that we will not forget
This is the life that we've been waiting for
I wouldn't change it for nothing

These are the times that we've been praying for
These are the moments that we will not forget
This is the life that we've been waiting for
I wouldn't change it for nothing

===================


Diamonds in the dust
That is all we are
Some of us give up
Some dream of the stars

There's a change in the wind that's blowing
And I've still got blood in my heart
Though we might not know where we're going
I promise we'll never be apart

Just pick me up
And never let me go
We don't need much
As long as we're together, together, together
(Together, together, together)
(Together, together, together)
We don't need much
As long as we're together, together, together

As long as we're together, together, together
As long as we're together, together, together

Heads under the sun
Wait for night to fall
Some get what they want
Some they lose it all

There's a change in the wind that's blowing
And we've still got blood in our hearts
Though we might not know where we're going
I promise we'll never be apart

Just pick me up
And never let me go
We don't need much
As long as we're together, together, together
(Together, together, together)
(Together, together, together)
(Together, together, together)
(Together, together, together)
(Together, together, together)
(Together, together, together)
We don't need much
As long as we're together, together, together

As long as we're together, together, together


===================


Walking through the door of this old and lonely
Place that used to feel like us
Remembering the only thing that made me
Feel like I was worth the love

We used to hold hands, now I dance alone
We had Springsteen playing so loud
We danced in the dark till it felt like home
With you home was anywhere

But you will never be left behind
Give me a moment, I need just a little more time
If I could I would have made things right
But we can't go back to the way that we used to love
Never apart you're still running through my blood
But we can't go back to the way that we used to love

But we can't go back to the way that we used to love
We can't go back to the way that we used to

Be talking through the night, you were laying by my side
You were always there to heal my scars
And into the dawn I do my best to try and find
Some sleep but you still keep me up

We used to hold hands, now I dance alone
We had Springsteen playing so loud
We danced in the dark till it felt like home
With you home was anywhere

But you will never be left behind
Give me a moment, I need just a little more time
If I could I would have made things right
But we can't go back to the way that we used to love
Never apart you're still running through my blood
But we can't go back to the way that we used to love

We can't go back to the way that we used to

But I can't escape, you're still in my head
I'm running from, I'm running from the emptiness
But I can't escape, you're still in my head
I'm running from, I'm running from the emptiness
But I can't escape, you're still in my head
Ooh, I'm running from, I'm running from the emptiness
But I can't escape, you're still in my head
Ooh, I'm running from, I'm running from the emptiness

We can't go back to the way that we used to love

===================


When every hour could be the last
Why would we wait
Why would we wait
And every road could be unsafe
But we'll be okay
We'll make it
We'll make it

It's just who we are
Say where to go
And I know that I won't slow down
It's just who we are
And we will do anything we dream about

How about now?
How about now?
How about now?
How about now?

===================


Where there's a will, there's a way, kind of beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated

For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul, the bones of the miracle
For every dreamer, a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around

We are one of a kind irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable 
No we can't be defeated 

Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around

===================


Remember we were staring up to those peaks on the horizon?
You told me if I faced my fears, there was no doubt I could climb them

There's nothing I have wanted more
The only one I've been waiting for
So hold your breath and close your eyes
The night is cold but the sun will rise

Counting down to the light, through the night
Just waiting for tomorrow
Almost there, almost time
All my life, just waiting
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more, waiting for tomorrow

Just waiting for tomorrow

Fear is creeping up behind as this road is finally ending
I can't find order in my mind but this noise inside so deafening

There's nothing I have wanted more
The only one I've been waiting for
So hold your breath and close your eyes
The night is cold but the sun will rise

Counting down to the light, through the night
Just waiting for tomorrow
Almost there, almost time
All my life, just waiting
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more, waiting for tomorrow

Just waiting
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more day
It's only one more, waiting for tomorrow
Waiting for tomorrow
Waiting for tomorrow

Waiting for tomorrow
