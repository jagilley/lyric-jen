Listen, seein' you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah
Tension between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart [Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no [Verse 2]
Listen, hard at buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin', you're just doin' that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart [Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no [Outro]
Tryin' to think of the right thing to say [Hook: Jorja Smith]
These things'll fall down
But you'll pick 'em up
You're still here to touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
I know you're trying to help me [Verse: Drake]
Tryna stay light on my toes
Just ran a light in a Rolls
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted
You hit it right on the nose
I'm tired of all of these niggas
I'm tired of all of these hoes
Worried 'bout takin' my lane
They ain't even got on my road
They turn they back and they leave you
They gon' be back when they need you
I practice good over evil
Flippin' the script like a read-through
Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal
I play my part too, like a sequel
You tell your niggas you got 'em on anything
Question is, do they believe you?
'Specially when you never come through
So much hate inside your heart
We don't even know what we done to you
We just know shit gettin' run through
Never chase it, let it come to you
You out here tellin' everybody everything
You niggas move like the one-two, yeah [Hook: Jorja Smith]
These things'll fall down
But you'll pick 'em up
You're still here to touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
I know you're trying to help me
I know you're trying to help me
I know you're trying to help me
I know, I know [Outro: Drake]
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know? [Intro]
Ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin', with like, some pimpin' to it, or something? That you can relax, pop a top to, or something? [Verse 1]
Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me
Or better yet, wait on me [Hook]
Nah, sha-nah-nah nah-nah-nah, sha-nah-nah nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way
Sha-nah-nah nah-nah-nah, sha-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way, nah [Verse 2]
At least do I get an invitation or something
A statement or something
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
But here's another nothin' that you made into something
Can't just leave it off that way... [Hook]

Skrrt [Intro: Kyla]
Baby I like your style [Verse 1: Drake]
Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray [Hook: Drake]
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me [Bridge: Kyla]
Baby I like your style [Verse 2: Drake]
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time [Hook: Drake]
And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me [Break: Wizkid]
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time
Oh yeah, very long time
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Oh yeah, very long time
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl [Bridge: Kyla + Wizkid]
Tell me
I need to know, where do you wanna go?
Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where
Oh yeah, very long time
Where, where, where
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl
Where, where, where, where
Cause if you're down

Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me You used to call me on my, you used to, you used to
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing Ever since I left the city I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost I've asked about you and they've told me things
But my mind didn't change
I still the feel the same
What's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours we both know
We know, they don't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thanking you, just don't know
Trying to run from that, say you're done with that
On your face girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the parties over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry,
You won't ever have to hide
And you seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes 'Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost It's my birthday, I get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I lie if have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know,
You hate being alone, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin' to save you
Instead they say [Intro: Nai Palm]
Is it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain
Using you high to be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release
And in your wake, ripple your sweet voice
And more chune for your head tops
So watch how you speak on my name, you know? [Verse 1]
Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin' up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit [Hook]
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye! [Verse 2]
Dom Rosé toast
Hidden hills where I post
Iced up, my day slow
Silk pajamas when I wake, though
Miraval to the face, though
I drunk text J-Lo
Old number, so it bounce back
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows and front-door money
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin' our name on a double cup
We ain't even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin' me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, "Aren't you adorable?"
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD
Bet on shots for twenty G's
I brought the game to its knees
I make too much these days to ever say, "Poor me"
Where you at? I never see you [Hook]
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye! [Verse 3]
Niggas moves so waste
Please come outside the house and show yourself
So I can say it to your face
It's bound to happen, man, it's gotta happen now
So let's just get it out the way
Lotta niggas goin' bad on me
Please, one at a time
I wanna move to Dubai
So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys
I didn't listen to Hov on that old song
When he told me pay it no mind
I get more satisfaction outta goin' at your head
And seein' all of you die
And I seen a lot of you die [Hook]
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye! [Verse 4]
Hidden hills where I post, yeah
Ye already know, yeah

Far as troublemakin' goes, yeah
House party up the road, yeah
I'm not Kid 'n Play
This kid doesn't play about the flow, yeah
Y'all keep playin' with your nose, yeah

This is not to get confused
This ones for you Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up

And I say the same thing every single time I say, you da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best

Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (yup)
I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one they never get confused wit 'Cause baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time I say, you da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best
You da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best
You the da best I ever had,
Best I ever had, best I ever had, best I ever had
I say you da fuckin' Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
When my album drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time I say, you da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best

But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne, Last name ever,
First name greatest,
Like a sprained ankle boy ain't nothing to play with,
It started off local but thanks to all the haters,
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis,
In your city faded off the brown, Nino,
She insists she got more class, we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo,
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo,
Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one,
Yeah nigga I'm about my business,
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list,
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness,
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness,
Bitches, It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne, Forever ever Mr. West is in da building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams,
Big fame, big chains,
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came,
I went hard all fall like the ball teams,
Just so I can make it rain all spring,
Y'all seen my story my glory,
I had raped the game young,
You can call it statutory,
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothin',
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin,
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband,
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't,
You're such a fucking loser,
He didn't even go to class Bueller,
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back,
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack,
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac,
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act,
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap,
I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back, It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,

I want this shit forever wake up and smell the Garden,
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target,
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans,
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops,
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top,
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops,
But what should I scream for this is my theme park,
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark,
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk,
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention,
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention,
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer,
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover,
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas,
No brake pads no such thing as last, It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne, There they go, packing stadiums,
As Shady spits his flow,
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic wow,
We can make them look like bozos,
He's wondering if he should spit this slow,
Fuck no go for broke,
His cup just runneth over oh no
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed,
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose,
Back into the game and they know,
Rap will never be the same as before,
Bashing in the brains of these hoes,
And establishing a name as he goes,
The passion and the flame is ignited,
You can't put it out once we light it,
This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about when we riot,
You dealin' with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin',
And spit true feelings,
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place,
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face,
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake. It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,

All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to money mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture

She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how I feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if it wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati
This is a gated community
Please get the fuck off the property
Rap must be changing 'cause
I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me
Niggas be wanting a verse for a verse
But man that's not a swap to me
Drowning in compliments
Pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis
I think I'm sellin' a million first week
Man I guess I'm an optimist
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars
Boy, Versace, Versace
We stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy
I've been so quiet, I got the world like
"What the fuck is he planning?"
Just make sure that you got a back up plan
'Cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label, the album is comin'
September, just wait on it

Hundred inch TV at my house
I sit back like "damn I look great on it"
I do not fuck with your new shit

Speakin' in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando

Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace

No offset no preacher but you niggas listen
Them blue and white diamonds, they look like the Pistons
Codeine sippin, Versace I'm gripping them bands in my pocket
You know that I'm living
I'm draped up in gold, but no Pharaoh
Rockin' handcuffs, that's Ferragamo
Bricks by the boat, overload
I think I'm the don, but no Rocco
This the life that I chose,
Bought out the store, can't go back no more
Versace my clothes while I'm selling them bows
Versace took over, it took out my soul Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace I love you so much!
But I hate what you've done
I know from here things will never be the same
And things will probably never change
I know what we want
Isn't exactly what god had planned
Hey its all I can do is
Hope you can see the difference
And pray for the best
Please don't forget me! I won't soothe your pain
I won't ease your strength Drake:
I should let you fall in love with
Someone else girl
I live in L.A
You in Chicago
You're not patient
I'm not patient
We shouldn't be together
I think we shouldn't be together
No more no (no more no)
Just think I'm where it all beginning
You're the envy of your prince
Plus you know you're not yourself anymore
The miracle of change
But if we got together it will never be the same like before girl
And I'm sorry
I said I'm sorry girl
(yeah)
She said look me in my fucking eyes and say it
But tell me am I wrong for what I'm saying Is it wrong of me to tell these women what they wanna hear
Try to control us
You wanna hold us down
Yeah you really wanna hold us down
Yeah you really wanna hold us All I asked is for a chance to prove that money can't really make me happy
Crazy how I blew myself from fucked up predicaments
I mean women inspire me to great things
(Drake: but always end up preventing me from achieving them)
I need to grow some fucking confidence
And why you gotta say the last word
And if I tell you how I really felt
(there probably end up being another argument candy girl,
You know everything you thought of me came from yourself)
Yeah
And that shit starts to get old
And I don't mean to say the most
But you know how they say you are who you hang with ?
SO IT BOTHERS ME WHEN YOU HANG WITH HOES Drake:
Is it wrong of me to tell these women what they wanna hear You know how they say
If you love somebody
That don't love you back
Love them anyway I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a f*** and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this s***, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, oh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that

You and me, only

Still, you were lonely
We can work it out
Uhh, But I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved
That person has it all
You just stuck standin' there
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
Say say something, baby, say something, baby, say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby Yeah, it really sucks whenever since I've been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see
Your life is good but me and you we're a catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied
I need a paramedic girl, I'm feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy
It's crazy, I can't help it if you're really ashamed
All the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change
Ah, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect girl, now it seems we don't match
Is it the money, want me to give it back? This shit was all I knew
You and me, only
I did it all for you
Still, you were lonely
We can work it out
Uhh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved
That person has it all
You just stuck standin' there
But I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
Say say something, baby, say something, baby, say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby I am the topic of conversation
This is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's 'all about location'
I'm sitting, drink wine and watch Californication of life
You should have been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up, fifty fifty
But now I'm at the forty forty getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should want to go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gonna be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
As long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing? I got my eyes on you,
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly
I can't get over you,

Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
I lost my way I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with someone else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you (Think about me)
Ah please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now Say to you
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you
The Mercedes coupe that you still drivin' was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Took up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Ah please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell 'em if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syd had a baby and treated me different
Erica sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they was here, shit could have been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since 'Take Care' I've been care-taking
But second chances, that ain't how you livin' Redemption on your mind I'll never be forgiving Yeah, I know Uh
Uh huh, uh huh
Look (Drake: Verse 1)
I let the beat bang
I don't claim colors
Honestly, the honesty is why the game love us
My women either centerfolds or on the main covers
Stunt so hard I make these niggas hate summer
And pray for winter
But when it's winter time
I'm still waitin' on these niggas at the finish line
We just took our first trip to the Amalfi Coast
Couple days on the beach
Then its adiios
(Killa)
Just look at what I done alone
You would swear we planted trees the way the money's grown
We been busy like some bees, no honeycomb
And you could probably feel the breeze when the money's blown
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase
I never be the reason that a bitch got paid
Even when I'm not functioning in tip top shape
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs
Drizzy (Drake chorus)
Uh
I'm tryina bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
I'm a mufuckin
Killa
Killa
Killa
Killa
Uh
And I'm the one to blame
Now that I'm around
Shit'll never be the same
I'm a.

(Listen, look) (Nipsey Hussle Verse 2)
Before rap,
My last name was my lifestyle
And when I visualize success
It look like right now
What was once gray skies
Is now white clouds
And I did it with the ones y'all said was not the right crowd
Follow my steps
And you see what I'm bout
I keep my money comin' in
And never goin' out
From Chuck Taylors on the pavement with the blammers out
Then I hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
And now my face bring the cameras out
That young nigga these industry bitches yap about
You know the one the cops bunk you up and ask about
All because I took my wildest dreams and then mapped 'em out
I go for mine like it's overtime
Me and my niggas had to struggle so we over-shine
Been fuck bitches
I been on my grind

It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alicia, Katia
I know that you gon' hear this, I'm the man
Yeah I said it, bitch I'm the man
Don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now, that's me
And the voice in your ear, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are, then I made it
And you're wasted with your ladies
Yeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded Take a shot for me, ooh
Take a shot for me, ooh
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me Okay look, I'm honest
Girl I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it Take a shot for me, ooh
Take a shot for me, ooh
Take a shot for me
A shot for me

Looking for a guy to put in work-a
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that, I'd never make you feel like that 'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you've been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love Yeah I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah? I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love Thinking 'bout Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I thought we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven
It seems like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh? I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love "Been Bocka AKA Not Nice from Timegiene been a East Side ting,

So hard to breathe this air that we call love,
Aint nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love,
When you get hurt by the one you living for,
Pain can make you wanna love no more, [Chorus]
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself,
(x2) Hurt with the heart thats bleeding slowly,
So many lonely sleepless nights,
Im going through hell to convince you love me,
But never her approval no matter how I try,
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you,
Im ashamed you can see it in my eyes,
Momma always told me to respect the woman,
But what am I to do when her parents do not try, So many tears I cried,
But all for nothing Im afraid to say,
Oooooohhh [Chorus] Ive been so dependent on your love for so long,
Punishment for me is trying to let go,
Give it from your heart is what you taught me,
Addiction to pain is what it got me,
My life, now its changed,
My life aint the same as you are,
Heartbroken, to the point sometimes wanna end it,
If I cant have what mean most to me, So many tears I cried,
But all for nothing Im afraid to say, [Chorus] [Drake]
Uh, trying not to over think
Only cause Ive drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And theres pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
And you still got underwear thats sittin in the dryer
How come every time that youre suspicious Im a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And thats the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what Im gone do
Since everything Im trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But ahhhhh, you see the same one Im missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then well be for sure [Chorus]
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself,
(x2) [End] All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only 'hello' or 'happy belated'
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
And right after texting, told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessey and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?
And I say (And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her pills
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you? (And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Damn right, all right (And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Damn right, all right

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one
A strong one Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money that we got, never get that shit Cause I'm on one
F-ck it I'm on one
Oh yeah
Oh yeah You know what I'm like, oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yes, Oh yeah
Oh yes, Oh yeah You know what I'm sippin, I teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one, cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slippin'
So you're the only one, cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slippin' and put in something different
So your the only one Cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slippin'
So you're the only one Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooo oooo oooo ooh Oh yeah, oh yeah
Lets call up on drinkin, lets all get wasted
On drinkin', lets all get faded Uh Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the the muthaf-cking north side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sittin' courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You actin' like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me how the f-ck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show
I can tell, I can tell, I can tell certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess they don't really make 'em like me no more
Uh, you can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
Cause if I was what y'all created then I'd hate myself
But still, let them girls in,
And tell em all leave their cell phones on the table where we see 'em
I'm all day with it man, AM to the PM
Niggas hatin', I just wish they would say it when I see em all That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been gettin' lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women wanna f-ck like their me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think I can find it in you, in you Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh oooo oooo oooo ooh Oh yeah, oh yeah
Lets call up on drinkin, lets all get wasted
On drinkin', lets all get faded
Oh yeah, oh yeah
ooooh ooooh trust issues When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different (oh ho, oh ho) We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different (Oh ho, oh ho) [Hook]
You know you know
You know you know [Drake - Verse 1]
Uh, you know you know how the story goes
You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow
You done seen me out, you gets no hello
And you wonder why? Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in '02, and everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but im still playin' like im bein' scouted til im outted
Game time bitch, I hope you're proud of us
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
And I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know [Hook]
[Drake - Verse 2]
Uhh, please make your long story shorter
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don't get held up at the border
Yeah so you can spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And I'm still spendin' money from my actin' days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
So we're courtside when LeBron get a fuckin' ring
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there
You see that '62 sittin outside? That's me there
I'm jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare
Putting in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin' I could have done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin'
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin' through the door
And kindly ignore, the paparazzi outside tryin to record
Why has every woman never dined here before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschilds, the Cru's, the Gajas and the Opuses
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin that that isn't what the motive is
They ain't rooting for me, they ain't clapping for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me?
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know [Hook] I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changing your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
'Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we should have just did things my way
Instead of the other way I tried with you
There's more than life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it Dedicate, I dedicate the world
Yeah, oh
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate Throwin' dirt on my old name
Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my psychic, I just wanna buy
Fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back
And never on the side, yeah You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you'll never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
'Cause we never decided
Tell me how you feel inside You a real ass woman and I like it
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say it's guaranteed
I mean you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on him
Girl I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate, woah yeah

This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit, one shit
All my niggas wanna do is pop style, pop style
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle, lifestyle Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum, they do
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man you boys just got to Hollywood
You boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this is for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got me They still out to get me, they don't get it
I can not be gotten, that's a given
They like Pablo why are all the windows tinted in your Tahoe?
Why do you know every single bitch that I know?
Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?
Fuck if I know, that's that Chicago, aye
South, south, side, that's the motto, aye
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, cause I know
We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, aye
Throne is back up in it, aye
In the field like Emmitt, aye, y'all get so offended, aye
I be blacking out, I ain't backing out
Jay about his business, and I'mma let you finish but I
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body
Take you to the garage and do some karate
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki
(Perfect) Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down
Get down, have her lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now?
Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now?
What more can I say now?

Aston Martin music, music (all night)
Aston Martin music, music
In our ride "Good God Almighty, like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R; men to tell you what to play
How to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock
But um, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had champagne in the studio, of course, you know
Compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much
As we enjoyed playing it for you, because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow" Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' about women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this got Michael Rapino boostin' my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growing 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talkin', say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink, I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Sean Don, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
'Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shoutout to Worldwide Wes
Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homie said "Hov, there ain't many of us"
I told him less is more, nigga it's plenty of us Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icing on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake
Uh I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Bigg made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel It's about us right now, girl, where you going?

I'm with you Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping in to your emotions
Dry cry 'cause I'm hopeless
Choosy your lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
I need you around, I need you, oh "That's the shit I'm talking about though, like
You changed up
You don't even fucking link nobody no more,
You just dash me away like a cyattie.
Yo, you cheesed me dog." Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you, shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas
Crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the Bar exam, I drove in the snow for you? Yeah you probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then, girl, how 'bout now?
'Cause I'm up right now ('cause I'm up right now)
And you suck right now (and you suck right now)
Oh you thought you had it all figured back then girl, how 'bout now
'Cause I'm right now ('cause I'm up right now)
And you suck right now (and you suck right now)

Yeah, girl how 'bout now
How 'bout now girl, what 'bout now girl, how 'bout now Yeah always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas, he ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from acting, I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CD's of my new shit
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
You be like "oh word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Like I was average like that
Started drinking way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year, guess
I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been
You ain't really fucked with me way back then but I wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love as a dodie
I fell in love with the Rollie
I wake up, pray every morning
These demons, they callin' my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta control If I can give everything back to you
All this passion I got, all I ever needed
For me to move on and succeed
For me to move on and succeed
Jealousy, envy and greed
Too much of that shit I don't need it I turned on the gas with a nickle plated
I sit back and laugh 'cause these niggas traitors
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me
I came out of trenches, I really made it
I come out the gutter, I really made it
I stack up the butter, I gotta save it
Stack up the cheddar, you gotta save it
Shoot out the car with no lovey dovey
These bitches, they lookin' for hubbie hubbie
I'm lookin' for paper in any city
I got a bitch located in every city
Gotta have 'em sticks on us in every city
Take the private, it's ugly out here we gettin' it
Spent like seven hundred thousand on both the Bentleys
I got love for the city, I juug and get it I wake up on a daily basis
I count the money, man I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love with the dodie
I fell in love with the Rollie
Wake up and pray every morning
Demons, they callin' my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control I need acknowledgement, If I got it then tell me I got it then
I'm ballin' outta control, keep on receiving the scholarships
Mail comin' to the house, nigga please, watch your mouth
I'm the one without a doubt, yeah
And I rock Kentucky blue on these hoes
Drafted, I'm gettin' choose by these hoes
Usually they just leave when we done
I don't wanna share no room with these hoes
Metro gon' make it boom on these hoes
And me, I just stick and move on these hoes
We got that purple rain for the pain
My niggas, we ain't change, we ain't change I wake up on a daily basis

I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love as a dodie
I fell in love with the Rollie
I wake up pray every morning
These demons, they callin' my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you Done saying, I'm done playing
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stacking up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Come places with star girls, end up on them front pages
I'm quiet but I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100
Lot of girls in my time there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is any one coming 'fore I show up there and ain't no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talking to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talking to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out" Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothing
There's issues at hand that we're not discussing
Look, I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's acting like, oh, well, this is life, I guess, "Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit"
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down
Writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you All of my let's just be friends
Are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should have tried to keep my family closer, much closer
All of my let's just be friends
Are friends I don't have anymore
Guess it's what they say you need family for
'Cause I can't depend on you anymore Always saw you for what you could have been
Ever since you met me like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like a Bentley I
Always saw you for what you could have been
And even when its business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now were meeting out end And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine Your so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm goin' through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judged me before you met me yeah it figures
I make all the players anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in LA I don't know whats going on I don't know whats going on
And its all becase you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time, yeah
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you you couldn't give me any advice
You always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving tomorrow like I'm working minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved you I'll always love you that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling a way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that All of my let's just be friends
Are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should have tried to keep my family closer, much closer
All of my let's just be friends
Are friends I don't have anymore
Guess it's what they say you need family for
'Cause I can't depend on you anymore

You would think I planned it
I'm just doin' me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered
Big dick bandit
Money flowin' like a slit wrist no bandage
Blowin' purple clouds n**** I'm so sky high
I ain't cuttin' anybody slices outta my pie
Outta this world though I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still I keep it movin' like a drive-by
I just tell the truth so I'm cool in every hood spot
Twenty one years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin' hook shots
Cover me I'm goin' in and I ain't f***in' with no hood cops I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'm a go hard (hard)
And I'm a go hard (hard)
And I'm a go hard (hard)
And I'm a go hard (hard)
B****, I'm goin' in (jizzle)

I'm goin' in (I'm goin' in)
And I'm a go hard (hard)
And I'm a go hard (hard)
And I'm a go hard (hard)
And I'm a go hard (and I'm a go hard) It goes hold up wait one motherf***in' minute
It's the el capatain
I got motherf***in' lieutenants
If I said I'm goin in then I motherf***in' meant it
And if I brought it in the club
Then I'm a motherf***in' spend it
Cost a few hundred bands
And I'm motherf***in' in it
No need for a room
Yea you know I'm f***in' in it
She actin' like she not but she know she f***in' with it
She said I seen it all
I said no you f***in' didn't
You ever busted nuts in a two seater
She said I can't feel my legs
I'm like b**** me neither
I'm goin' in
Where should I begin
I don't even know maybe where my blunt ends
And I'm a be a legends even when my life ends
And I'm a be a legend even when this night ends
Til I do my thing hop up out it like biem,
B**** I said I'm him so I'm nothin' like them
I'm goin' in! I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in

And I'm a go hard
And I'm a go hard
And I'm a go hard

And I'm a go hard (hard)
And I'm a go hard (hard)
And I'm a go hard
And I'm a go hard (yea, yea) Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, hoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Wooh, dance our dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy do I smell beef? Mmmm pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll bitch I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man [Woman on phone]
"Hello
Yeah I just walked in
Yeah I'm good you still working?
Tonight, right now?
'Did I go out?' yeah, I went out
I went, I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed
Shit wine or water
You should see someone about a cold drink
I don't know, I'm delirious night" [Drake - Verse 1]
Cups of the Rosy
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy But I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say
"Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had"
I say, "fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around" (Are you drunk right now?) I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doing that's so important?
I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call you anyway and say "Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had"
I say, "fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"
(Are you drunk right now?) I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin talkin' 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm concious of making monsters
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad
But shit it's all good
We threw a party, yeh we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeh, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on [Drake and Woman on phone]
"Well I'm sorry" [Drake]
"Are you drunk right now?" [Woman] I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me [Drake on phone]
"You're not going to come?"
"Guess I'm bout to just kick it here then" Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"
I hope no-one heard that
I hope no-one heard that
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble [Kendrick Lamar]
Looking in the mirror I'm embarrassed
I'm feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestling hands
I was dope when I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a canadian
That gave him an addiction
That would keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rhianna as a lady friend
My vice is similar women love when your my type
And you win it from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Channel
Live the ambiance all cause the audiance
One day said I would do it
So instead of a verse being read
Ima go 'n get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
Capitalize That, and you weave look good
With the indian tracks
Tracking device on your used 5 series
I don't call back just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word
Like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black maybach 40 pulled up G
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation
A reality living in the matrix
We talk casualy about the industry
And how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin'
Then he said that he was the same age as myself
And it didn't help cuz it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on mr OVOXO, the reason why I'm breathing on the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason was the highlight was when he said
You alone to the people till you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
And bury yourself alive, then I died

Let the suicide doors up
I threw suicides on the tour bus
I threw suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean Im fly to death
I step in Def Jam buildin like Im the shit
Tell em give me fifty million or Ima quit
Most rappers taste level aint at my waist level
Turn up the bass til its upinyoface level
Dont do no press but I get the most press kit
Plus yo my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin bout Mary she gone off that molly
Now the whole party is melted like Dal√≠
Now everybody is movin they body
Dont sell me apartment Ill move in the lobby
Niggas is loiterin just to feel important
You gon see lawyers and niggas in Jordans
She said Ye can we get married at the mall
I said Look you need to crawl fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
Ball so hard That shit cray aint it Jay

Bougie girl grab my hand

Bow on our arrival the unAmerican idols
What niggas did in Paris got em hanging off the Eiffel
Yeah Im talking business we talking CIA
Im talking George Tenet I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know white people get money dont spend it
Or maybe they get money buy a business
I rather buy gold chains and go ignant
I know Spike Lee gon kill me but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment we living no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination MTV cribs
Now Im looking at a crib right next to where TC lives
Thats Tom Cruise whatever she accuse
He wasnt really drunk he just had a frew brews
Pass the refreshments a cool cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crews presence
Speedboat swerve homie watch out for the waves
Im way too black to burn from sun rays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Everytime Im in Vegas they screaming like hes Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real got me feeling Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli or Gisele no thats Brazilian
Went through deep depression when my momma passed
Suicide what kinda talk is that
But I been talking to God for so long
That if you look at my life I guess hes talking back
Fucking with my clique

They ordered champagne but still look thirsty

And I know with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey their backstroke Im tryna perfect
And hey ayo we made it Thanksgivin
So hey maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first you gon remember how to forget
After all these longass verses
Im tired you tired Jesus wept
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as theres permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up am
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos one read No Apologies
The other said Love is Cursed by Monogamy
Its something that the pastor dont preach
Its something that a teacher cant teach
When we die the money we cant keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain aint cheap
Preach
Now if I fuck this model
And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my Tshirt
Imma feel like an asshole
I was high when I met her
We was down in Tribeca
She get under your skin if you let her

I dont even want to say nothing
Everybody gon say something
Id be worried if they said nothing
Remind me where I know you from
She looking like she owe you some
You know just what we want
I want to wake up with you in my beautiful morning
My momma was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasnt satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see its broke nigga racism
Thats that Dont touch anything in the store
And its rich nigga racism
Thats that Come in please buy more
What you want a Bentley Fur coat A diamond chain

Imma put you on game for the lames that dont know theyre a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy
Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds passenger seat something pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldnt let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list I wasnt even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs somebody gon get fired

And Stacks man you preach it to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches

Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I cant fault em really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she aint going back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin

Textin and drivin down Mulholland Drive
Thats why Id rather take the
I be worried bout my daughter I be worried bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye I aint worried bout him
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents
What Im supposed to do
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints
Every agent I know know I hate agents
Im too black Im too vocal Im too flagrant
Something smellin like shit thats the new fragrance
Its just me I do it my way bitch
Some days Im in my Yeezys some days Im in my Vans
If I knew yall made plans I wouldnt have popped the Xans
I know some fans who thought I wouldnt rap like this again
But the writers block is over emcees cancel your plans
A yearold yearold with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I dont never drive it
It took months to get the Maybach all matted out

And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers eye fuckin bitin ass
Neck ears hair legs eating ass
Your pussys too good I need to crash
Your titties let em out free at last

Uh she cut from a different textile

And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it til the right time
Then she came like AAAAAHHH

And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic

Got treasures in my mind but couldnt open up my own vault
My childlike creativity purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child Im fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinking
Colin Powells Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation

New God Flow fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer write it in bold letters
They love a niggas spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Pusha aint fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay as a wholesaler

Picture workin so hard and you cant cut through
That can mess up your whole life like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to Im from the
Where cops dont come through and dreams dont come true
Like there the god go in his Murcielago
From workin McDonalds barely payin the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom
killings in a weekend killings in a week
Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains
In Jesus name let the choir say

And well annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know they admire Ye
Ello ello ello hello white America assassinate my character
Money matrimony yeah they tryna break the marriage up

On a bathroom wall I wrote
Id rather argue with you than be with someone else
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo Id rather be by my fucking self
Till about two am and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help
You werent perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you aint getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin you
Lying say I hit you he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud whos provoking you
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and cant nobody get control of you
AM and cant nobody get a hold of you
Im calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Yall got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That aint right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I aint your right girl
Youll probably find one of them I like arttype girls
All of the lights shewascaughtinthehype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame you to blame me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game
Things used to be now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
Weve become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of LOVE
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely Chloe Mitchell
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You aint pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing the whole thing the whole thing
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit thats the tea no sip
Dont trip dont trip that pussy slippery no whip
We aint trippin on shit we just sippin on this
Just forget the whole shit we could laugh about nothin
I impregnate your mind lets have a baby without fuckin yo
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin
Thuggin hustlin before you met your husband
Then I said What if Mary was in the club
Fore she met Joseph around hella thugs
Cover Nori in lambs wool
We surrounded by the fuckin wolves
What if Mary What if Mary
Was in the club was in the club
Fore she met Joseph with no love
Cover Saint in lambs wool
And she was We surrounded by
Surrounded by the fuckin wolves‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã
I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I cant jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
Im the only one thats in control
I been feeling all Ive given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God Im willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul
See before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You aint never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that last time the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times just to say dont text me hoe
Told you four times dont test me hoe
Now we finna lose all selfcontrol
But you aint finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But Imma have the last laugh in the end
Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah Imma have to laugh Indian
Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
And I
She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I dont know what it is with females
But Im not too good with that shit
See I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know thats what Im good at
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I dont know how Imma manage
If one day you just up and leave
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I told God Id be back in a second
Man its so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure under more scrutiny
And what I do act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry more Louis V
My Momma couldnt get through to me
The drama people suing me
Im on TV talking like its just you and me
Im just saying how I feel man
I aint one of the Cosbys I aint go to Hillman
I guess the money shouldve changed him
I guess I shouldve forgot where I came from
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldnt tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homie this is my day
Class started hours ago oh am I late
No I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Dont ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon end up apologing
Let me know if its a problem then aight man holla then
Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He dont even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes cause
How he move in a room full of nos
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes
Must be the pharaohs he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure whats your pleasure
Life is a UH depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear Prada Adam Eve wear nada
Im in between but way more fresher
With way less effort cause when you try hard
Thats when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you my God

Step up in this bitch like turn me up
Im the one your bitch like
Yeah Im the one your bitch like
And I be talkin shit like
I aint scared to lose a fistfight
And she grabbin on my dick like
She wanna see if itll fit right
Thats just the wave
Sun dont shine in the shade turn me up
Bird cant fly in a cage turn me up
Even when somebody go away turn me up
The feelings dont really go away
Thats just the wave yeah
I fantasized bout this back in Chicago
Mercy mercy me that Murcielago
Thats me the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You aint got no fuckin Yeezy in your Serato
You aint got no Yeezy nigga
Stupid but what the hell do I know
Im just a Chitown nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire Im the King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest hey teacher teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students
And refresh the page and restart the memory
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy
We stopped the ignorance we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But whats worse the pain or the hangover
Fresh air rollin down the window
Too many Urkels on your team thats why your wins low
Dont make me pull the toys out huh
Dont make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines huh
And then they make noise
Penitentiary chances the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin for the love of ballin
Got caught with rocks the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that its random
But we stay winning this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
This the real world homie school finished
They done stole your dreams you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I wont be satisfied til all my niggas get it get it
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as Im in Polo smiling they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldnt sack me
If a nigga aint shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the Worlds game this is my Olympics
We make em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs niggas cant resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasnt the greatest nigga I must have missed it
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said ‚Äútake them glasses off and get in the pool‚Äù
Its been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip said I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I dont believe in yesterday
And whats a black Beatle anyway a fucking roach
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like Im sniffing coke
Its not funny anymore try different jokes
Tell em hug and kiss my ass x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I aint had a belt in two classes
I aint got it Im coming after whoever who has it
Im coming after whoever Who has it
You blowin up thats good fantastic
That yall its like that yall
I dont really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things my black balls
Cutie the bomb met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said I can tell you rock I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock

But Im looking for the one have you seen her
My psychic told me shell have a ass like Serena
Trina Jennifer Lopez four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to showbiz
Okay get your kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fucking with this girl then you better be paid
You know why It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she used to fuck with Usher
I dont care what none of yall say I still love her
Eighteen years eighteen years
She got one of your kids got you for eighteen years
I know somebody paying child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor got lipo with your money
She walking around looking like Michael with your money
Shouldve got that insured Geico for your money
If you aint no punk
Holla We want prenup We want prenup Yeah

Cause when she leave your ass she gon leave with half
Eighteen years eighteen years

He got that ambition baby look in his eyes
This week he mopping floors next week its the fries
So stick by his side
I know theres dudes ballin and yeah thats nice
And they gonna keep calling and trying but you stay right girl
And when you get on hell leave your ass for a white girl
May the Lord forgive us may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions oh she do it
What happened to religion Oh she lose it
She putting on her make up she casually allure
Text message break ups the casualty of tour
How she gon wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the asshole I guess its rubbing off
Hood phenomenon the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
Im looking at her like this what you really wanted huh
Why we argue anyway Oh I forgot its summertime
When the sun go down its the magic hour
And outta all the colors thatll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up
Dont leave while youre hot thats how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot at the bar take a seat
I ordered the jerk she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
Thats Dior Homme not Dior homie
The crib Scarface could it be more Tony
You love me for me Could you be more phony
Damn Yeezy and Hov where the hell ya been
Niggas talking real reckless stuntmen
I adopted these niggas Phillip Drummond them
Now Im about to make them tuck their whole summer in
They say Im crazy but Im about to go dumb again
They aint seen me cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week I was in my other other Benz
Throw your diamonds up cause we in this bitch another gain
I made Jesus Walks Im never going to hell
Couture level flow is never going on sale
Luxury rap the Hermes of verses
Sophisticated ignorance write my curses in cursive
I get it custom you a customer
You aint accustomed to going through customs
You aint been nowhere hah
And all the ladies in the house got them showing off

Cant you see the private jets flying over you
Maybach bumper sticker reads What would Hova do
Jay is chillin Ye is chillin

Lord please let them accept the things they cant change
And pray that all of their pain be champagne
Im so appalled Spalding ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from yall
Baby youre fired your girlfriend hired
But if you dont mind Ima keep you on call
We above the law we dont give a fuck about yall
I got dogs thatll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers I need more rubbers
And if I dont use rubbers need more covers
Housekeeping I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get Os like Cheerios

That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke voila
Praises due to the most high Allah
Praises due to the most fly Prada
Baby Im magic tada
Address me as your highness high as United

Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit man they out of work
Thats why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
Thats why Id rather spit something that got a purp
Man I promise shes so selfconscious
She has no idea what shes doing in college
That major that she majored in dont make no money
But she wont drop out her parents will look at her funny
Now tell me that aint insecurr
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three yurrs aint picked a carurr
She like fuck it Ill just stay down here and do hair
Cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her babydaddy dont really care
Shes so precious with the peer pressure
Couldnt afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealin with some issues that you cant believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well
Man I promise Im so selfconscious
Thats why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I cant even pronounce nothing pass that versaysee
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you aint up on this
And I cant even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest selfesteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our acres
And for that paper look how low we a stoop
Even if you in a Benz you still a nigga in a coupe
I say fuck the police thats how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail but we cant buy freedom
Well buy a lot of clothes when we dont really need em
Things we buy to cover up whats inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
Thats why shortys hollerin where the ballers at
Drug dealer buy Jordans crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that

Park they ass outside til the evenin end
When I go raw I like to leave it in
When I wake up I like to go again
When I go to work she gotta call it in
She cant go to work same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin close to him
Yeezus just rose again
I drink a Boost for breakfast an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry Mr HtotheIzzos back to wizerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her sons on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal shed been trying to be mine
She a Delta so shed been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin to be lyin I been tryin to be signed
Tryin to be a millionaire how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots but I aint Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I aint trying to make a band
I swear this right here history in the making man
What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around

Except hes really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude bad night right place wrong time
In the blink of a eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt

Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the stores departments
You more like love to start shit
Im more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors doeuvres views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man why cant life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like Where are you Yeezy
And try to hit you with the olwuwopte
Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi
I know its been a while sweetheart
We hardly talk I was doing my thang
I know it was foul baby
Aye babe lately youve been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Fronting though yo I wouldnt wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
Itll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past you on the other side of the glass
Of my memorys museum
Im just saying hey Mona Lisa
Come home you know you cant roam without Caesar
The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the rednosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain my seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Aint nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin all the good beats for himself
RocAFellas only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Pauls goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air here
They say he bougie he bigheaded
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious give me seconds
Ill have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
Its funny how wasnt nobody interested
Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus
Now was Kanye the most overlooked Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
Thatll take Freeway throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwali or Kweli I put him on songs with JayZ
Im the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as BunB when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous now everybody love Kanye
Im almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant Can yall blame him
It was straight embarrassing how yall played him
Last year shoppin my demo I was tryin to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldnt rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas so they say that Im gassed
But without it Id be last so I ought to laugh
So I dont listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you cant dress no more
You cant say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked people I was just on tour nigga
Im Kan the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I aint play the hand I was dealt I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
Oh my god is that a black card
I turned around and replied Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express
Brains power and muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle you know what Ive been up to
Killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaisecolored Benz I push Miracle Whips
I met this girl when I was years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said Excuse me lil homie I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tow em off
And make em straighten up their hat
Cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said It felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye keep making that keep making that
Keep making that platinum and gold for me
But if you really cared for her then you wouldnt have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking bout me
She said You left your kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you and I just got through
Talking bout what we tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got til its gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that When I was back home
Every interview Im representin you makin you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd spark your lighters wave em around
If you dont know by now Im talking bout ChiTown
It was all good just a week ago niggas feel theyselves
And that Watch the Throne drop niggas kill themselves
What niggas gon do Hov
This a new crack on a new stove

And if lifes a bitch bet she suck my dick huh
And I bet she fucked the whole clique huh
By the way nigga you should fucking quit nigga

No paper ho but you can have some more of me
Oragy or are we speaking metaphorically
Historically Im kicking bitches out like Pam nigga
Going H¬∑A¬∑M nigga

But Ive been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
Had a few white girls asses flat as shit
But the heads so good damn a nigga glad he hit
Got em jumping out the building watch out below
A million out the door Im about to go H¬∑A¬∑M
I treat the label like money from my shows
GOOD woulda been God except I added more Os
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
Its cause I was too busy with my Baltimore you know
Some people call that the art of war you know
I guess it depends what you falling for the clothes
Cars money girls and the clothes
Aw money you sold your soul
Nah man mad people was fronting
Goddamn we made something from nothing
Youre my devil youre my angel
Youre my heaven youre my hell
Youre my now youre my forever
Youre my freedom youre my jail
Youre my lies youre my truth
Youre my war youre my truce
Youre my questions youre my proof
Youre my stress and youre my masseuse
Ma ma se ma ma se ma ma ku sa
Lost in this plastic life
Lets break out of this fakeass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each others arms still get laid yeah yeah yeah
My wife said I cant say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin Im in debt
And like my wife said I still didnt say no
People tryna say Im goin crazy on Twitter
My friends best advice was to stay low
I guess its hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin
The media said hes way out of control
I just feel like Im the only one not pretendin
Im not out of control Im just not in they control
I know Im the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generations closest thing to Einstein
So dont worry about me Im fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought dont need to question
I know its antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God For Jay Electra he down with the mission
Did it with with no permission on our own conditions
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Dont stare at money too long its Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasnt supposed to make it past
Ive been wakin the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children listen to the kids bro
If the phone ringin go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldnt balance a checkbook
But buy a new car talkin bout how my neck look
Well it all looks great
Four hundred years later we buyin our own chains
The light is before us brothers so the devil workin hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary
I am one with the people
I am one with the people real
Ive been woken from enlightened mans dream
Checkin Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if Im up way too much Im out of touch
Im prayin a outofbody experience will happen
So the people can see my light now its not just rappin
God I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know I know he got a plan I know Im on your beams
One set of footsteps you was carryin me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin me
One set of footsteps you was carryin me
When I was negotiatin with Apple it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me I was scary to see
I wouldve took a hundred million and gave to Hov
I heard its the way they did it when we only had a stove
But its better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then Ima never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time Im on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself lookin for niggas like wheres Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped em at Aldo

Scared to face the world complacent career student

Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin moneys not everything not havin it is
I was splurgin on Tryst but when I get my card back
Activated Im back to Vegas
Cause the good life I always had a passion for flashin
Befo I had it I closed my eyes and imagined the good life
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boys street team I couldnt work the locks
Now lets go take em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that UHaul van
Any pessimists I aint talk to them
Plus I aint have no phone in my apartament
Lets take em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line Dawg in due time
Now he look at me like Damn dawg You where I am
A hiphop legend
I think I died in that accident cause this must be Heaven
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
Id do anything to say I got it

Before anybody wanted K West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog I was having nervous breakdowns
Like Man these niggas that much better than me
Baby Im going on an aeroplane
And I dont know if Ill be back again
Sure enough I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it things became different
Any girl I cheated on sheets I skeeted on
Couldnt keep it at home thought I needed a Nia Long
Im trying to right my wrongs
But its funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
Close your eyes and imagine feel the magic
Vegas on acid seen through Yves St Laurent glasses
And Ive realized that Ive arrived

I ask if you talked about classics do my name get brought up
I remember I couldnt afford a Ford Escort
Or even a fourtrack recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a droptop Porsche
Its for yourself thats important
If your stripper name Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me thats just the Henny man
I smoke I drink Im supposed to stop I cant because
I was sick about awards couldnt nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
minutes later sein theres no convincin him
What more could you ask for The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed
And throw a tantrum like he is years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldnt change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game he made his own lane
Now all I need is yall to pronounce my name
Its Kanye but some of my plaques they still say Kayne
Got family in the D Kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi them Folks aint from Moe Town
Life movin too fast I need to slow down
Girl aint give me no ass ya need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call you got a message then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw em up like you bulimic
Yeah the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit it sound like the best of
ARs lookin like Pssh we messed up
Grammy night damn right we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe yeah he next up
People askin me if Im gon give my chain back
Thatll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog Yo where Dame at
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
Whats up with you and Jay man are yall ok man
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
Rrrrright here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
At the tender age of she was arrested for the sitins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas cant make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacobs and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just dont be feelin it
Racisms still alive they just be concealin it
But I know they dont want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sams Club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear Ive been baptized least or times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girls father passed away
So I promised to Mr Rainey Im gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I cant complain what the accident did to my left eye
Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side
Its the Hard Knock Life Tour sellout picture
Us in the mall coppin Iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yeah thats what well yell out yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell bout
JAY and Ye so shy
Now he wont even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind He could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig
But he got me out me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib
Fresh off the plane Im off to Baseline
Nothing handed out Im bout to take mine
round the same time of that Blueprint
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
Id play my little songs in that old back room
Hed bob his head and say Damn Oh thats you
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Partyin SOBs and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And Im like Yeah yeah we gon be there but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin a little different
And kept little brother at bay at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess Ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now Im on the top and everybody on the scrotum
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client the Presidito hola Hovito
The game gettin foul so heres a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now Im on the steeple
And we know New Jack City got to keep my brother
But to be number one Imma beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pickandroll
Cause even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind Im like Damn no way
Translate espanol No way Jose
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and thats what made shit worse
And Ill never let my son have an ego
Hell be nice to everyone wherever we go
I mean I might even make him be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And Ill never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
And Ill never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean even if people dyin and the world ends
See I just want him to have an easy life
Not like Yeezy life just want him to be someone people like
Dont want him to be hated all the time judged
Dont be like your daddy that would never budge
And Ill never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way that aint the place to get love
And Ill never let his mom move to LA
Knowin she couldnt take the pressure now we all pray
I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache
Make her knees shake make a priest faint
Make a nun cum make her cremate
Move downtown cop a sweet space
Livin life like we won the sweepstakes what
We headed to hell for heavens sakes huh
Well Imma levitate make the devil wait yeah
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin from inside the screen you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal or do a gangbang
Its kinda crazy thats all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang bang bang bang bang
One day Im gon marry a porn star
Well have a bigass crib and a long yard
Well have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin to hide we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna role play til I roll over
Imma need a whole day at least rolled doja
What party is we goin to on Oscar day
specially if she cant get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta they wouldnt rent her they couldnt take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her ‚ÄúGet away‚Äù
How could you say they live they life wrong
When you never fuck with the lights on
Mmm aint this some shit Pulled up in the AVentador
And the doors raise up like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show and a tour and a movie and a score
This a ghetto opera Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques Rick Rossd told me that
Said Id be all up in Goldman Sachs like These niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back Im just trying to protect my stacks
Mitt Romney dont pay no tax Mitt Romney dont pay no tax
ChiTown til Im on my back ChiTown til Im on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills where the hell is Axel Foley at
Ease up there baby boy Ving Rhames told Jody that
R Kelly and the God of rap
Shitting on you holy crap
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and Im finna let it shine
Im finna take yall back to them better times
Im finna talk about my mama if yall dont mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup can I have another bowl
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove but didnt give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy cant you see
Seven years old caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz a nigga cheatin telling you lies then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy Imma love you till you dont hurt no more
And when Im older you aint gotta work no more
And Imma get you that mansion that we couldnt afford
See youre unbreakable unmistakable
Highly capable lady thats makin loot
A livin legend too just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel and I thank you Hey Mama
Forrest Gump mama said Life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like its things I gotta get
Things I gotta do just to prove to you
You was getting through can the choir please
Give me a verse of You Are So Beautiful To Me
Cant you see youre like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou Nikki Giovanni turn one page and theres my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey yall say Mama now everybody answer me Hey Mama
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world let me take you out
To a restaurant upper echelon
Imma get you a Jag whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of SType Donda West like
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It dont gotta be Mothers Day or your birthday
For me to just call and say Hey Mama
And I heard em say nothings ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi like Tim its a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
AllƒÅhu Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen thats not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where Im from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they cant cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars I know it
They say people in your life for seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus and one day that you see him
Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam cant put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cause his skin blacker than licorice now
I cant figure it out Im sick of it now
Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Arent you a sight for red eyes
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown you asleep with no makeup
Im just tryna be inside you fore you wake up
We had problems but its all in the past
Everybody got problems baby algebra class
Remember I used to do things thatd make you laugh
Like orderin a girl drink in a masculine glass
You like pi√±a coladas getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Aint no denying baby you have changed
Cause now your high heels clicking your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching youre pissed off tripping
Cause even when were kissing baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like No he didnt
No he didnt is you talking about Kitten
Is that bitch still stripping
Trying to get a pair of Christians
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say How is work baby
Well some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe I call you back and say that you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
See she knew about all my lies the whole time
And my credits so bad I cant get no one to cosign
I wouldve thought she wouldve bust in the door cryin
But she upped and left a nigga and she aint give me no sign
Now she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame its a miracle that shed
Talk to a nigga with a tenyear ago swag
Plus I dont like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends
On the phone hollin that niggas is whatever
Lets fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Now she heading to Rome Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she aint got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong except a nigga grown
So I cant bitch and moan in a session gettin stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress
Thirty foot train diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides Im so glad you came
Aunty couldnt make it oh no thats a shame
Wedding in June what could be better
Lets fly to Euro make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor Just drive so far
Told some of your friends and they wasnt excited
Well we gon tour the countryside and they wont be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussin and fighting
Tell Peaches light the herb cause we just reunited
Lets make a move from these herbs go somewhere in private
Im talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Ayo I know of some things that you aint told me
Ayo I did some things but thats the old me
And now you wanna get me back
And you gonna show me
So you walk around like you dont know me
You got a new friend well I got homies
But in the end its still so lonely
How could you be so Dr Evil
You bringing out a side of me that I dont know
I decided we wasnt gonna speak so
Why we up AM on the phone
Why do she be so mad at me for
Homie I dont know shes hot and cold
I wont stop wont mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that youre leavin me
They say that they dont see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months then you gonna see
Youll never find nobody better than me
You dont see just how wild the crowd is realize
You dont see just how fly my style is realize
I dont see why I need a stylist realize
When I shop so much I can speak Italian realize
I dont know I just want it better for my kids realize
And I aint saying we was from the projects realize
But every time I wanna layaway or deposit realize
My dadd say when you see clothes close your eyelids realize
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son realize
In the movie I aint talking bout the rich ones realize
Cause every summer
Hell get some brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from realize
And I dont know what he did for dough realize
But hell send me back to school with a new wardrobe
When it feel like livings harder than dying realize
For me giving ups way harder than trying realize
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion realize
I wish her heart still was in rhyming realize
Cause who the kids gon listen to huh realize
I guess me if it isnt you realize
Last week I paid a visit to the institute realize
They got the dropout keeping kids in the school realize
I guess I cleaned up my act like Princed do realize
If not for pleasure then at least for the principle realize
They got the CD they got to see me realize
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE realize
They used to feel invisible realize
Now they know they invincible
I paid for them titties get your own
It aint safe in the city watch the throne
She say I care more about them basquions
Basquiats she learning a new word its yacht
Blew the world up as soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called told me I fell in love with her
Seat by actors ball players and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved niggas
Twisted love story True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance
Im a freak huh rock star life
The second girl with us thats our wife
Hey boys and girls I got a new riddle
Whos the new old perv thats tryna play second fiddle
No disrespect Im not tryna belittle
But my dick worth money I put Monie in the middle
Where she at In the middle
Ill never be pictureperfect Beyonc√©
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet He was as black as the street was
Ill never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fakeass facade that they couldnt keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah
Ill never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like WillIAm
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything Im not made me everything I am
And Im back to tear it up
Haters start your engines I hear em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Ok fair enough the streets is flaring up
Cause they want gun talk or I dont wear enough
Baggy clothes Reeboks or Adidos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP award
Goodbye to the India Arie award
Theyd rather give me the Nigga Please Award
But Ill just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award
I know that people wouldnt usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year Chicago had over caskets
Man killings some wack shit
Oh I forgot cept for when niggas is rappin
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody pastor
The church want tithe so I cant afford to pay
Pink slip on my door cause I cant afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up but I got more to say
Thats enough Mr West please no more today
You sweat her and I aint talkin bout a Coogi
You a Big L and I aint talkin bout Cool J
See me at the airport at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
Brother Numpsay groupies say Im too choosy
Take em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays I still have it my way
Yall dont want no prob from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern and in turn
Ill show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour he had to let it burn
Plus he already got three children
Arguin over babysitters like bitch its yo turn
Damn Ye itd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is superofficial
RRRRoc pastel with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride throw a movie on
Said he couldnt rap now he at the top with Doobie Long
Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on gone
Uhuhuh uhuhuh uh uh onnn uh uhuh onnn
Uhuh onnn uh uhuh
Im ahead of my time sometimes years out
So the powers that be wont let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunts house
Yeah I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me Benz or Rover
Man if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheapass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteenyearold
Sell drugs or get a job you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell hooked us up plural
Fired a week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I cant believe it when I look up in the mirro
How we out in Europe spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got til its gone
I know I got it I dont know what yall on
Ima open up a store for aspiring MCs
Wont sell em no dream but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
Youll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on Ill handle it dont start panickin stay calm
Shorties at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life they souls and they songs
They said Sorry Mr West is gone
I told my mama I was on the come up
She said You going to school Ill give you a summer
Then she met No ID and gave me his number
Ten years later she driving a Hummer
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
What I do Turn around gave them beats to Jay
And Im rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
I guess Im getting high off my own supply
Downtown mixing fabrics tryna find the magic
Started a little blog just to get some traffic
Old folksll tell you not to play in traffic
A million hits and the web crashes damn
South Park had them all laughing
Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin
Ignore the critics just to say we did it
This aint no fashion show mothafucka we live it
Ive been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think Im never wrong
You know what maybe youre right aight
You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves word
Do you even remember what the issue is
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It aint happen yet
And thats what intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means
And Im back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And thats why Im
Seven oclock thats primetime
Heavenll watch God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines
Im a star how could I not shine
How many ladies in the house
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean
You wonder if youll ever find your dreams
If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then Im gonna shorten the register up
Lets go back back to the Gap
Look at my check wasnt no scratch
So if I stole wasnt my fault
Yeah I stole never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye lets put him all in the front of the store
So Im on break next to the No Smokin sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin my hits writing my hits
Writin my rhymes playin my mind
This fuckin job cant help him
So I quit yall welcome
Yall dont know my struggle
Yall cant match my hustle
You cant catch my hustle
You cant fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doing beats a day for summers
Thats a Different World like Cree Summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
So many records in my basement
Im just waiting on my spaceship
Nnnnow my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets I got the bounce like hydraulics
I cant call it I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
Til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said Ise a loser I told her why dont you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me Im gonna follow
My heart and if you follow the charts
Or the plaques or the stacks
You aint gotta guess whos back you see
Im so Chi that you thought I was bashful
But this bastards flow will bash your skull
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Tro
And I dont usually smoke
But pass the dro
And I wont give you that money that you asking for
Why you think me and Dame cool We assholes
Thats why we hear your music in fast forward
Cuz we dont wanna hear that weak shit no mo

We never had nothin handed took nothin for granted
Took nothin from no man man Im my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dopeman
Only adult man I knew that wasnt broke man
Flickin Starter coats man
Man you dont know man
We dont care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
Cause this summer they aint finna say next summer Im finna
Sittin in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil Treys scholarship
Cause aint no tuition for having no ambition
And aint no loans for sittin your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job
You gotta do somethin man your ass is grown
The second verse is for my dogs workin to that still hustle
Cause a nigga cant shine off
And everybody sellin makeup Jacobs
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money cop work then push packs to get paid
And we dont care what people say
Momma say she wanna move South
Scratchin lottery tickets eyes on a new house
Round the same time Doe ran up in dude house
Couldnt get a job so since he couldnt get work
He figured hed take work
The drug game bulimic its hard to get weight
A niggas money is homo its hard to get straight
But we gon keep bakin til the day we get cake
And we dont care what people say
You know the kids gon act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS some of em dyslexic
They favorite Cent song Questions
We scream rocks blow weed park see now we smart
We aint retards the way teachers thought
Hold up hold fast we make more cash
Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class
Sad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
Im tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we dont live here
Look what was handed us fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers go on call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But we dont care what people say
My niggas
This is family business
And this is for the family that cant be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down know the answers in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your grannys picture
Now that youre gone it hit us
Super hard on Thankgiving and Christmas this cant be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man This Cant Be Life
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate soul food know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side know how the family do it
When I brought it why the guard have to look all through it
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast
Who knew Id have to look at you through a glass
And look tell me you aint did it then you aint did it
And if you did then thats family business
This is family business
And this is for everybody standing with us
Come on lets take a family Grammy picture
Abi remember when they aint believe in me
Now she like See thats my cousin on TV
Now we gettin it and we gon make it
And they gon hate it and Im his favorite
I cant deny it Im a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin
Grandma get em shook up
Aw naw dont open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that cant remember your name
But I bet them Polaroidsll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie you dont mean to be rude
But every holiday nobody eating her food
And you dont wanna stay there cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you aint took a bath with your cousins
Fit in the bed if its of yall
Im talkin bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you aint have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed
I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin sun

Tention to detail is so uncanny
And the whips on the Sprewells its so unCamry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh suits and Ferraris
Cute your shorty watch Barneys we head to Barneys
End up at Marni Giorgio service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year last year was magic
Lyrically cant none of yall murder Ye
Cause yall raps aint got no vertebrae
I got style ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris raised the murder rate
First of all we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majestys swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin board when I am bored
All my homies GDs but I am Lord
Rap god Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Heres somethin that you could use in analogy
My life is like a childs illusions become reality
Can I talk my shit again

Louis Vuitton stitch with Donatella Versace

Class back in session so I upped it a grade
Two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade
And Hey

Im like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
Im pop the Barkers Im hood the Parkers
While yall was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game rocachain instead of a wedding ring
Yall bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when Ye romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that Yayo dance
Im on a world tour with Common my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
Its easy
The hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy
And oh yeah Yeezy
I did it for the glory
What am I supposed to do now
Man the game all messed up
How Im suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up
So yeah at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego
I can stand there in a speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory the story the chain the polo the night
The grind the empty bottles of NoDoz
Tank on empty whipping my mammas Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes shit that you dont floss
The Goyard so hard man Im Hugos boss
Why I gotta ask what that Tudor cost
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And Im asking about her girlfriends

She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented em
When you meet me in person what do you feel like

I hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know BIG and Pac you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Any one Big Pun Big L or Notorious
Till then get money and stunt and stay glorious
And Im gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
I miss the misogyny bad bitches massagin me
Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please dont judge me uh for the followin
Fat bitches swallowin skinny bitches modelin
Take off that Givenchy and lets get raunchy
I have your face looking all Captain Crunchy
The devil stay testing cause when you chase the pussy its a sin
But if it falls in your lap its a blessin
Soon as I got salad I spent it all on dressin
French to be exact that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers
My homie Mali used to stay at th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me KRock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know hes the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers even more by polices
Howd he get the cash The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil somethin he was stuntin
Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway go at least bout eighty
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby
See backback thenthen if you had a car
You was the ChiTown version of Baby
And I was just a virgin a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
Wed take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras we was hurtin em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin involved but dog
Fuck all that flirtin Im tryin to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes homie
He told me dont rush to get grown drive slow homie

That are now ARs in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls thats way too fine for us to keep off us
Gave her a handshake only for my mans sake
She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake
Now theres crumbs all over the damn place
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood planned parenthood
Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that wont make it to the family will
If I dont make it cant take it hope the family will
They aint crazy they dont know how insanity feel
Don C just had a shorty so its not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had
No electro no metro a little retro ahh perfecto
You know the demo your boy act wild

Though the jewelrys Egyptian know the hungers Ethiopian
Stupid questions like ‚ÄúIs he gon be dope again
Have you seen him has anybody spoke to him‚Äù
This beat deserves Hennessey a bad bitch
And a bag of weed the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your lifes cursed well mines an obscenity

Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head stop breathe get up check your weave
Dont drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and dont disrespect your seed

Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set
Twista said Get It Wet
Ooh girl your breath is harsh

So I keep in mind when Im on my own
Somewhere far from home in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you fore it finally got through

But Im not loving you the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going keep the loving going

But my heads so big you cant sit behind me
And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
Id never do that to you at least purposely
We breaking up again we making up again
But we dont love no more I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights yall have a bad fight
And you talk about her family her aunts and shit
And she say Motherfucker your mommas a bitch
You know domestic drama and shit all the attitude
Id never hit a girl but Ill shake the shit out of you
But Imma be the bigger man
Big pimpin like Jigga man
Oh I guess I figure its
And my niggas said I shouldnt let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we gettin currently
But I been thinkin and it got me back to sinkin
And this relationship it even got me back to drinkin
Now this Hennessy
Its gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I cant even vibe with you sexually
Cause every time that Id try you would question me
Saying You fucking them girls disrespecting me
You dont see how your lies is affecting me
You dont see how our life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you aint cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone you always be where them hos will be
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card
And all I got was a brand new sports car oh
Dad cracked a joke all the kids laughed
But I couldnt hear him all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong
My godsister getting married by the lake
But I couldnt figure out who Id wanna take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave before they even cut the cake
Welcome to heartbreak
Driving around town looking for the best spot

Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that What Gil Scott was hearing
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland

Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it cut it measure it bag it
Sell it the fiends cop it nowadays they cant tell if
Thats that good shit we aint sure man
Put the CD on your tongue yeah thats pure man
From the place where the fathers gone the mothers is hardly home
And the Madigans lock us up in the Audy Home

Cause dreams of being Hova
Went from bein a broke man to bein a dopeman
To bein the President look theres hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin
and this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you round that
You cant buy this Superflyness like a shine is
Your Highness is performing look how long the line is
Its what happens when you make shit thats timeless
Its what happens these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is
Thats so novice Im so polished
I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish
I did a lil bit of college
Semesters it took two like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasnt my place
The beats slow til you listen to my pace
Cause I be killing shit but thats evident
And yall feeling it but I expected it
If its classic its gon last forever then
Im everywhere you never been and better than I ever been
Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
Thatd turn my life to Stephen Kings
Up late night like she on patrol
Checking everything like Im on parole

She never let it go oh
Just looking at your history
Youre like the girl from Misery
She said she aint take it to this degree

Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her theres some things she dont need to know
She never let it go oh

Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon have to take my life fore they take my drive
Cause when I was barely livin thats what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind fore Im out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say

Spanish girls say Yo no hablo ingl√©s
And everybody want to run to me for their single

Dawg if I was you Id kill myself
Made a mil myself and Im still myself
And Imma look in the mirror if I need some help

Its still wonderful night to be alive baby
And Im so happy Im with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin for the mall dont trip you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that ‚ÄúYou the star at the top of my Christmas tree‚Äù
My only question is ‚ÄúWhere my presents‚Äù
She said ‚ÄúShhh‚Äù she got a gift for me that aint for the kids to see
Well I like the way you think mami
Now pour some more eggnog in you drink mami
Youve been a bad girl give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate she said ‚ÄúIts Deericious‚Äù

All that talking is gon give me a Tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep Im tired of yall
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off
See you know my style
Im very wild
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy
And tell him that your mama had a fattie
He looked up at me said daddy thats the reason why you had me
Yep we was praticing
Til one day your ass bust through the packaging
You know what though You my favorite accident
So go head pop some Cristal
For my newborn child cuz now yall
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trip
And Im the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But itll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told Id know to laugh
Man man I wouldnt let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you dont really know cause you cant recall them
Its sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life real life if you try to
So close so close but so far so far
And so far so far no cigar no cigar
We cant dwell on the past all we got is today
So Imma live like its no tomorrow
No goodbyes
Her heels set the mood
Where did you acquire those Alaias
When I met you I heard Jesus bells strings and the choir
I got lines thats better than niggas albums plural
The king of the urban make your shit sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need a epidural
Them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
Now that nuts I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Tell them Plain Pat yo that track sucks
We aint dissing you
But you in the position to play something for us to listen to
Im trying to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I aint stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie
And if Im a douche then put me in your coochie
I swear they should have never gave these niggas loose leaf
And excuse me if Im trapped by the boobies booby trapped
They try to tell me my chain broke the levee
Maybe cause its flooded
Why you walk around with a baby crosss cousin
My teeth already white yall gon make me floss for nothing
My teeth real diamonds whats the cause of the fronting
Why yall got all caps on
Don Cheadle time get extra black on em
Burn Hollywood burn
Take too long for niggas to get they turn
Probably be cremated before I get my earn
They try to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids
I swear lifes a bitch on a period
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx
I make my jeweler add a few more links
You can look at me tell I dont give a fuck what nobody think
And my face always looking like somebody stinks
Question what color was the skin of the man who beared the cross
No matter how many lashes they couldnt beat it off
How many Cassius will we see in one lifetime
Thats why its Miles Davis Kobe its Mike time
I keep that GOAT book on the ottoman
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in the s
Yall forget that I got called nigga
On Twitter so many times yo I lived that
Now Im just tryna find where to raise my kids at
Cause they dont want niggas next to where they crib at
Hey realtor Im lookin for a nice park
Twelve noon she said my family gon make it too dark
This is the flow that solar eclipses
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse
The bullshit they got us listening to in this existence
Dont give up now just a little more persistence
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson
Keep him away huh Something might happen
This is the making of a masterpiece
So we broke out the chains and told the master Peace
I sold my soul to the devil thats a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a Happy Meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me fake bitches I cant take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
Im an only child lost in the World
Where do the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Its feeling like Hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didnt have the ends
I wouldnt have so many imaginary friends
Im spaced out Dogg I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we aint finna change so well never agree again
Till then Ill be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed
I sold my soul to the devil
I know its a crappy deal
At least it came with a few toys
Like a Happy Meal
Im spaced out dog
I be on that moontalk
I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk
You know the entertainment Angels
Adriana for Giselle
Lets exchange Angels
Photoshoot at my crib
Lets exchange angles
Rockin nothin but them Tom Binns bangles
My heart so anxious gettin anxiety
Begging one of these fuckin fashion houses to hire me
They say Ive been an asshole
I said if you acquire me
I can be a quiet me call it verbal dieting
Give me your herbal chai tea
Ill be calm as Tai Chi
With a bad white bitch like IceT
Im not right dog Im slightly off
Im paranoid like bonin raw dog
And wakin up with a slight cough
Yea thatll make ya dick quite soft
Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off
Never meant to hurt you I shouldve had nights off
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off
Dont let me hold you back I only hold you back
Were on a deadend street this block has got a culdesac
So fly baby my baby so high
Sometimes its so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to the valley
We pulled up at the valet well teach our daughter ballet
Well raise us a Beyonce maybe shell be a Halle
You wouldve been the best mom I would have been the best Ye
You see it all in my veins like varicose
I know thats very gross but we getting very close
To our end though I killed most with a pen
Soon as this flow end Imma let Mos begin
You know what I figured out Im not a nice guy
I shook hands kissed babies gave it a nice try
You know what I hate pictures of other peoples kids
I hate plastic couches in other peoples cribs
I hate when other peoples cribs smell like shit
I hate when I leave and smell like the crib
Whats the cause of the poor smell
She said I just cleaned up
Baby I cant tell
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell
Or that god damn cucumber Bath and Body Works
I can still smell the sweat the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water That shit probably worse
This here a classic like the Lodi Dodi verse
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I score he took the charge
Oooh that shit gotta hurt
Its the nigga they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check check my swag and get up to date
We in the bathroom now she get her back blew out
She cant clean but I bet she got a vacuum mouth
And I bet Im going to sweat her Vidal Sassoon out
Her pen busted goddamn who brought the raccoon out
For the team
He walked in our lives I was only five
Superman pajamas I was super duper fly
Sittin there like why He at least HooperSize
You know I scrutinize like Who this newer guy
Im my mama boyfriend Im her little husband
I was the man of the house when it wasnt
Tryna get to know me homie Just kill the charm
You aint interested in me you just tryning to fuck my mom
We all the voices of our parents bad choices
The aftermath of divorces the kids of bitter splitups
And babysitters and grandparents dont know what do to with us
And the last thing I want to see is mamas new nigga
You old Old Spice wearing short chain wearing
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing church sock wearing
When you first stop caring about your appearance
When you get here anyway I already got parents
Dont try to put me in line I already got crayons
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance
Keep your hands off my mama how Anita got Clarence
Yall I know she look good but you need to stop staring
I drew a picture of her thatd make her proud
But the door was locked and the TV up so loud
I screamed out I aint going to sleep no time soon
And when I do Im sleeping in my mamas room
Twenty years later where has the time gone
Now you see Im dating having problems of my own
Now that Im grown the tables turned around
I never thought Id ever raise another niggas child
He dont like his mamas boyfriend just like me
Dont wanna do the wrong thing thats very unSpike Lee
But he be like D Bo round his mama there
Cause when she here he be quiet when she leave he be talking again
He be wilding out be calm
I dont drink the drama or sip the DomTylerPerryon
You gonna marry my mom Look I dont read palms
And I dont read Psalms but I did take little man to church
Took little man to school
Look little man kids dont make the rules
Even though I aint raised you you your mamas angel
Dont get it twisted baby boy Ill Ving Rhames you
There must be more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
Thats why a lot of girls claim they aint into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wasnt bi
No I seen it in her eyes
But Im like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And Im like if you dont get your ass in this ride from Enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by
With the gas fully filled up like I didnt drive
Told her I had a girl nah fuck it I didnt lie
Told her this rap game is alright Im just getting by
She had a lil weed and would get a lil high
And Im looking in her eyes and Im loving her vibe
Told me back in she fell in love with the Tribe
Boo back in I was just like you
Please dont be confused by the ice and jewels
Im like any other nigga buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think yeah Frees banging but shes no Rachel
Was it something I did wrong
Yeah I know Im wrong
Shes at home alone and Im always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though man that hurt yo
But I got work though and Im at work yo
And she dont call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
You never listen to me then the call drop hmmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal Ill get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges strip club splurges
Never had money so I felt like a virgin
And Im trying to break the banks cherry
Tryin to see can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry
Went from fifty gs to fifteen hundred in a week
No Im trying to callone ringtwo ringsseven ringseight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like she in school and she dont stay here no more
I guess theres more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
I guess thats why she says she aint into guys
And focus on school fulltime to improvise
Somebody told me that Deltas brownskinned AKAs lightskinned
And they supposed to be bougie so they got white friends
First day of school Imma take you sight seein
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
She said I know what you about to say like your hypeman
Last year a nigga hit her and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her its frightnin but
Roll some think Ill roll some
To know some if we both honest
Who lasts yeah you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know whats mine when I see it
I know I know I know when I see it
Riding down the baby
Pacing thinking to myself
If I should make it right
When I pulled up to the light
And then my phone started ringing
Diamonds in the colors of those eyes
Dont know why but I know a sign when I see it
Yeezy Neyo the remix ayo
I think its time to hit em with the Mase flow
My uh she was gettin the best of me
But oooh child you my destiny and I know its especially
Hard with all these girls just testing me
Uh and you gon question me
If she even stand next to me but you should laugh
Cause you my better half woman laughing
And these girls just fighting over the rest of me
Right now it feels so crazy I know she just some lady
And my outfit is just so s
Not to mention McLaren Mercedes
And the inch rim wheels looks so good with your inch heels
Fly that you be on
Gucci on aligned by Louie Vuitton
And we high as the way we cruising on
High like I like mercury
Why do I mention the solar system
Cause you in my soul and system
And we gon take her home with this one
I got something that you gon like
You got something that I cant fight
We got something that we both gon like
My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
Its been a whole lot of hatin again
And if they hatin on me damn what up then
I met this girl when I was years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said Excuse me little homey I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tow em off
And make em straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye keep making that platinum and gold for me
But if you really cared for her
Then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her it always seem like she talkin bout me
She said you left ya kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you
And I just got through
Talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till is gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that when I was back home
In the interviews Im representin you makin you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds
Spark ya lighters and wave em around
If you dont know by now Im talkin about Chitown
Get you a cute chick face got potential
Working with her little hips waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you but you know how Ye do
Says she love Beyonce let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain says is that HeSus
If Im unfaithful blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift they all up in
She aint pregnant but about to have twins
Now is it real love I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them Ds
Walking down Melrose spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad tell by the Chloe bag

Especially if you paid a couple payments on her Mamma crib
Went to her nieces graduation man I hate those kids
Last birthday she got you a new sweater

Lets take it back to basics
When shit gets worse we converse
How we need a New Balance before the lines get crossed like Asics
Just look at what we got if we dont shoot the Reeboks
This is a beat that no flow can detox
So the respect is due like my Louie back
I dont wanna have to check you

Some say my beats made the Bulls play better
I say black on black is the hate that hate made
Sara Lee with the dough Im talkin bout the cake maid

Uh I wish I could give you this feeling I wish I could give you this feeling
And when The Workout Plan aint work out man
Me and Common is back on the corners again
On the corner
Yo mad niggas got dreams of the Lexus and coupes
Got their signin bonus and bought TECs for the video shoot
Ayo them shits backfired before the cameraman arrived he died
For his image now lets start the scrimmage
In the first quarter I sacked MCs
By halftime you still got rhymes but they are diseased
They infected with seconds of life left
I cremate MCs and breathe they ashes in my lifes breath
In a life or death situation
I come through with the Chi representation
And bleed you pussies every month like ovulation
The sensationll shine through your mind
Take it line for line
Look I feel bad about the fact that you gotta creep with me
When your man be around you dont speak to me
When my girl be around I see you peepin me
When they both aint around you be freakin me
We used to do it secretly now you all talk
You tellin everybody like you wanna get caught
I think my girl catchin on cause my story keep changin up
You gotta stop callin up my crib and hangin up
Truthfully if you tellin people that you doin me
Then you tellin me that you dont even wanna screw with me
And thats a shame I cant even do my thing
You get dick and you go temporarily insane
You think its a game but I dont wanna play no more
You wanna stay but you cant stay no more
You wanna be with K but that aint okay no more
You got somethin to say but you aint gotta say no more
It seem like fine hoes is hard to find mostly
The type of girls that give you their whereabouts supposedly
And when you check they aint never where theyre supposed to be
I learned my lesson now I only fuck hoes thats close to me
Dont get me wrong you still gotta live close to me

You still ratchet cause they play your favorite song and you twerk
Designer purse on your arm bout the size of a duffle bag
And them brand new titties cost a couple racks

Monica Lewinsky on the dress you take her to the cleaners

Maxin relaxin shootin some pool and
Playing some bball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre

The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium
And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victorias Secret show they miss me
Voices in my head I need choices in my bed

I dont understand why they trippin if you ask me
Flow is just the nicest
I admit the propane
I just spit probably
Just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club
Try and get as fresh as me
What you want dog
Trying to stay recession free
And spit refreshingly
When I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty
You should bring a extra tee
Now Im standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But youre here with me
Thats good for my ego
Me and my ego
And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league
One day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego
On a scale of one to ten what do you rate yourself
Heres some champagne hydrate yourself
I know Im lookin good you lookin great yourself
I mean you shittin on these bitches you should hate yourself
My style so cold I could skate myself
But I go so hard I could make it melt
I mean the flow so solar every bar
Could power an electric car

So thats a middle finger for you haters
I got my superman power my superman cape
These the last hours but superman late
The clock is ticking damn can you wait
Man will he come back and save the day
Fly across the earth put things in reverse
I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse
Certain things I cant doctor and you say Im the worst
I aint have enough patients but I needed a nurse
Thatll come by my bed late
See if my head ache
Then get my head straight
Then give my head great
Every time I popped up like the VCR
I took your breath away then we performed CPR
With all the cars the clothes the lights the boats
I guess I was just trying to sow my royal oats
In the penthouse position
With penthouse bitches
See I Pimpd My crib so I must exhibit
Shit these last years been a haze like Issac
So I close my eyes
Tighter than Asian eyes get
Realized I got the same wings angels fly with
Louis Vuitton feathers now that some fly shit
Verbal asked me do I need a pen
Not right now
Everything I write now
I dont even write down
I dont need her right now
But Im so bad
Ask her can she hold my gonads before they go bad
Since I did a song with Teriyaki I been acting very cocky
Using every opportunity to shit on everybody
If you heard Ill be in Houston like Bobby
Puffing on a blunt until the B got me body
There fees in the party
Chillin in the lobbies
Anything you heard happened yo it probably did
Full Force trying to find where the Party is
For the last time to kick it like Karate Kid
Man that line was way obvious
Way out of my jurisdiction of my high snob
On my job kill a nigga no prob type flow

Passion of the Christ Year Old Virgin

I hear it over and over and over like a echo
I see it in my dreams I feel the effect though
People drowning in debt

Everybodys saying we need something special
Nah man we need something extra terrestrial
Outta this world speak for us

With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
Cant wait till they say Ye ran up at the Oscars
Poppa I heard his life is like a movie
Like when Em played him and Mekhi played a rasta
Mexicans gonna love it like it was for La Raza
But this is for the mobsters Holla
We some true Chitown legends accept no imposters
And we standin on the couch
With my drink and my two step my drink and my two step
Three glasses in a row you start to think I was QTip
Bartender pour a round I took a few sips

Make it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out
Or grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club in the club tryna mingle

Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out

Then please keep your eye on me
These niggas is bringing out the worst side of me
When you wired me

To become the higher me
These execs
All want the details
How I made the world bounce like
Full messages on emails
But they hiding something like shemales
So
We still
Pull up in Sprewells
The ice and me chill
Like Goldmember I love gold
Whats the point to gain the world if you lose your soul
Now
Niggas forcing me to keep the heat up
Black strap white handle I got jungle fever
I went platinum
And I dont rap guns
My diamonds is whiter than Michael Jacksons
Me and Miri make music you can hold in time
So take a second to listen it may blow your mind
Ahh The sweet taste of victory
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin Damn Ye snapped with this beat
Fuck you expect Ive got a history
Groupie love now gotta be them wheels
Haters back down gotta be that steel
I know they cant wait till ya outta ya deal
Look how they did DAngelo ask em how do it feel
My best friends worry bout me
Cause they know when you famous
And you had made cash
The media aims at us
And you be up so high
If you ever fall off it feel like a plane crash
But God dont ever give me nothin I cant handle
So please dont ever give me records I cant sample
So I could vacate where it aint no channels
But its quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
Im somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess its messin with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
Im just gon check myself in again
Yeah history in the makin Do or Die
Yeah yeah uh uh uh
Me and Do or Die got maneuvers
Cold pimp tactics all in one package
Hollerin at a chick that could of been a actress

Why your team pissed like urine
Only rock things made for a king
Tell me tell me it was the LV
Bigger that the jeans of the
Rap floor green
Thats how I gotcha
So I you want a role model to call like Patra
Quit hollerin at them losers
And get with this shit that
Got his own business an entrepreneur

When I get my Bentley they gon call me Bentlino
Lot of shit changed since I hooked with JayZ yo
For the tracks I done got Cnotes
So glad I aint take the drive to Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repod
Fuckin with my girl today around threeoh
My man said lets call some girls that we know

Sometimes I wanna say fuck my bitch
But I dont want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin chick sucked my dick
It wouldnt make me now feel so sick just because
They came over to cheer me up
Smoked drink and yeah we fucked
No matter what they do it cant be enough
Ever since I been flossin
My girls totally awesome
Girls wait to exhale
They dont breathe often
Claim that my game stone cold Steve Austin
Claim that I boss em
Basically Diana Ross em
But whos to blame for all these fights
When you aint always wrong

And I just always like
To see exactly how your face look
Right when I walk down that hallway right

What you need to do is turn it up some decibels
And put some more zeroes in front of that decimal nigga

But if you keep it then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin
And you went raw dog when you beat it
Thats when she gon tell you to beat it
You know it aint yall little secret you famous you cant go nowhere
Cause everytime you go there its hoes there
So basically you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her Man dont say that
Matter fact like Pat dont say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin on pay stacks
Things come up from way way way back

Dont try to treat me like I aint famous
My apologies are you into astrology
Cause Im Im tryin to make it to Uranus
See thats a little Don Juan game
All across your chest like Sean John name
Niggas tryin to figure out since Kan came
Who the rookie of the year me or LeBron James
They say whoa dont get caught up in the hype
Aint no tellin they gon love you after tonight
Well if tonights the night pop bottles fuck models
Spend money til you broke my nigga live your life
Now how the hell I end up arguing with this bitch aww
Know everything but dont know shit aww
Kinda reminiscent of Anna Nicole Smith aww
I just turn my music up like Damn thats some cold shit aww
I mighta known her bout a couple of months
Since then she gained a couple of chunks
She went from being a strobe light
To that old lady on Boomerang
Lady Eloise I need no lights
And I swear she a riot folks
How she order all that food and a motherfucking Diet Coke
He said You lying yo why is you lying yo
Cut it out quit it G you hurting my kidineys
Naw she talking bout a couple of kids for me aww
Shes hinting at a ring from Tiffanys
Right then and there I had an epiphany
I swear since that day Ive been treating fat hoes differently
Theres only one girl on my agenda
You talking bout Brenda
Naw Im talking bout Linda from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda Lovelace
LaFace says she like Mase but she love Face
And I know that Linda was a hiphophead
And I know that Linda gave HipHop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I aint here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She aint hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin grgreen she was like chching
Got em but she know a rreeal nigga when she spot him
So now shes pickin dresses from Vera Wang
Scratchin out her maiden and heres my name
Now Im sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin Cheers to you for your future years of pain
Like Dog you ready to give all this shit up
The summers on its way and these hoes doin situps
And when they see the way the G lights lit up
Youre gonna wanna have two like John Ritter
But naww I bought her a brand new BM
He said Dog slow down like Brand Nubian now
It cost Kobe seven digits to pay off Bridgett
And get acquitted and break that bitch off cause he aint did it
Here go the Henny swig it
You know its frigid
I got em chillin in the cooler
Break out the ruler
Damn

We smokin killer Cali gettin weeded

Now we feel the good vibrations
So many BIs so much inspiration
Hey miss
Whos there
No time to do hair

The show tonight
So get right
You look aight
Lets club now
A rub down
Starts flavor while we grind in the theater
Im tryin to cut in the movies
Im tryin to give her something else to drink besides a smoothie
Niggas is jealous cause we in drops
The cops wanna stop us about every four blocks
Cause what we smokin them sacks got no seeds
And what they got in they pockets is no cheese
Now bring some more stacks
Before you ask
About the price of the tracks
The game on smash
Look

Because in fact
My freestyle hours over powers
Brothers cant hack it
Sensitive to truth and mack bitch

From what I hear Kanye is killing the game very bad
My girl rocking the little lamb that Mary had
A l ittle bit of Ghosts style mixed with Mos style
Im versatile Im the poster child
Getting cheese so Im suppose to smile get it
We making hits like Sosa now hit it
And I hate when girls acting bougie as hell
And I already seen them naked like Blu Cantrell
If I talk to people like they stupid as hell
Do that mean God gone make my kids be stupid as well
Well our father please forgive me
Im sinner slash winner slash soul inventer
Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley they gon call me Bentlino
A lot of shit changed since I hooked with JayZ yo
For the tracks charge around Cnotes
So glad I aint take the job at Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repod
I broke up with my girl today around
My man said Lets call some girls that we know
Sometimes I wanna say Fuck my bitch
But I dont want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin chick sucked my dick
It wouldnt make me not feel so sick
Just because they came over to cheer me up
Smoked drank and yeah we fucked
But nothin that they did couldve been enough
Now this weed drank got me faded
That Malibu is so underrated
She mad at me thats an understatement
I can just see your girlfriends hatin
Girl told you dont leave his ass
And when that nigga blow he gon leave your ass
But when he get low he gon need your ass
If he cryin callin bawlin
Yallve been together too long for all this name callin
Yallll be back together in a day or two
Yeah we be makin up but when we makin up
All were makin up is the truth
Damn I know she love me oh
But Im in the Matrix and Im feelin Im Neo
She could fight for my love like Aaliyah
Or write a four page letter like Aaliyah
But Im a Gemini thats bossy like a Leo
And sometimes I dont know what side Im on
I just know this Patr√≥n got me gone
And Ive done fucked up so bad that I cant go home
Kanye the best in the game now we got that that thing clear

If I come in the middle of the night then Myleka Imma do whatever you like
Good morning to umm I dont remember your name
But I remember the brain here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to ChiTown where my niggas ride down
To bust clowns and look for some bust downs to bust down
Yeah she aint got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone cause she was bad to the bone
She from a battered home she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to peep off she wanted to take a week off
Bustin Scary Movie nuts I had to get the freak off
That new Tom Cruise to the Moulin Rouge
On a too long cruise she said I aint bonin you
With them too long shoes and acted bougie in a Grey Poupon mood
So Imma act cheap in a coupon mood
She said Ye you dont love me
I told her it was good its too bad it got ugly
Listen yo
I drove to New York with ten dollars to my name
Brought back a couple platinum plaques on a plane
Brought back the soul to change the game
Had a little beef I had to aim its stainless steel
The lyrics in my heart I cant restrain they real
I swear to God I wish I had a dollar bill
For every time a nigga told me stick to the beats
I could have ate at Cheesecake at least six times a week

And I dont wanna cheat but I dont be saying shit
I try to jack off he ask me who is you playin wit
But I know he love you he told me you was his favorite
I had that little ass Nissan at your crib showin up
Liquor store out of Arbor Mist we Irish Rosed it up

You had Gap and Gucci thats still two Gs
But thats that last year purse like its still too cheap
Ooh you so bougie boo you could have fooled me
Cuz five years ago you was so Fugees
Now you dont want nothin unless it cost a few Gs
You like the lightskinned Ania the darkskinned Aaliyah
The black Jennifer Lopez a ghetto senorita
You remind me of my Jeep but not no Kia
We can talk on your cell but not Nokia
It be goin in and out thats why I barely hear ya
It be goin in and out like a robbery ah
Im tryin to take this money like Rob and G Dep
Then Imma take you to the house like Trick and Trina
My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend
My freak girl told me now she a Christian
My White girl wanna move back to Michigan
Im pulling girls off the bench like a sixth man
Im in the club doing the same ol two step
While Omegas doing the same ol Q step
I have my money on my mind I was thinking green
She a pledge AKA she was pink and green
I want a good girl she want a gentleman
We saying the same thing like a synonym
I wasnt really spitting game I was scrimmaging
My penmanship so hard it needs censorship
Im a Chicagoan till Chicago ends
Till we blow like Chicago wind
I dont know whats better getting laid or getting paid
I just know when Im getting one the others getting away
This way
Plain Pat what up
Lifestyles of the broke and famous
Let you know how crazy this game is
Look at all the new beautiful faces
At home supermodel myspaces
Long for their shot on the TV screens
American Idol never seen these dreams
Just last week they want to see ID
Now they got you in VIP huh
How many people almost famous
You almost remember what they name is
Like Hey didnt you play in No it couldnt be quit playin
Try to keep that balance
After MTV thats a Real World Challenge
Back on that train

Yes Mr Wests turn that new child rebel
Loud as a badass child level
Who need a chorus We do it tyrannosaurus
Tyrone its been a year with no phone
Could you explain how high is your zone
Well take the plane rub his nose in cocaine
Theres hoes in magazines you layin saying youre lame
And for the hate in advance pull down your pants
Make em kiss both cheeks like we living in France
Diamonds blue his business managers Jewish
And if I get sued my lawyers Jews
Some girls do grab the cojones
Say you got enough diamonds to at least Sierra loan us
Brand new Ferraris I gotta make the donuts
CRS is like a hiphop Chris bonus
Niggas is hating on the internet I couldnt tell
I was too busy rapping GOOD as hell
I was too busy flying parasail
To Colette to get the new shit that Paris sell
Tarantino Da Vinci getting Benjies get half off of Fendi
Half of thats to Cindys
Hopped out the spaceship put my Mork in Mindy
Popped too many corks to let you dorks offend me
Props in New York but ChiTowns the city
Get my groupie hoochies Gucci Monica Belluccis
Are those the real millionnaires or the bendies
Im so ultra Im even over Oprah
But let me check your account haha no sir
Niggas be lovin the old Ye they sayin the new Ye that nigga be spazzin
But when Ali turn up and be Ali you cant ever change that nigga back to Cassius
So you can gon and make up lies but Im so sanctified
I dont sweat it wipe my forehead with a handkerchief
And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus Ross grunt
People sayin Ye we need another Yeezus Ross grunt
Lames try to tell me Cut the wildin out out
But who the fuck is you reachin
Pass me bottles champagne procession
Thats that Holy water sanctified refreshments
God sent me a message said Im too aggressive
Really Me Too aggressive
You say you wrong you wrong Im right Im right
Youre wrong we fight
Ok Im running from the light running from the day to night
Oh the quiet silence defines our misery
The riot inside keeps trying to visit me
No matter how we try its too much history
Too many bad notes playing in our symphony
So let it breathe let it fly let it go
Let it fall let it crash burn slow
And then you call upon God
Oh you call upon God
We keep these Gs in an alloy safe
And stash the weed in an Altoids case
They say good things come to those who wait
So Imma be at least about a hour late
Im so fresh bitch I should be arrested
New Cody Chesnutt with my nuts on your chest bitch
She said ‚Äúhey Ye‚Äù
I said ‚ÄúYes bitch‚Äù
Damn Im only asking you a question
I met this milf at the AllStar getting action
A cougar with more rings than Phil Jackson
Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs
And her booty is why God invented my balls
Im a rockstar huh start it up
Start it up huh start it up
So popular you should get a shot of us
Niggas dont take shots at us that is only obvious
The first album I vomited the second I colonicd it
Aint nobody fucking with me I Platonicd it
Bet I got some slippers on bet niggas gon honor it
These aint even real clothes homie Im pajama rich
Banks told me homie go switch the style up
These bitches on me homie only to arouse us
Told her I aint paying tonight Im only browsing
She pulled her blouse up said ‚ÄúIts free‚Äù I said WOWZERS
Im going in and Ima go hard
I mean whats the point if it aint no scars
A little teeth marks
Blood on the collar
Thats real love mmhmm ahhnah
She said uh
How could you love someone that hurt you played you spoke to provoke you
How could you love someone that burns you turns you into a werewolf
And in the moment you might do some things youre not aware of
No ones prepared for the scale of this and now you fear love
And war and war and more and more drama looking for a score
State youre looking for a tour
Her allure is more couture tailormade
Til your screams in rage
I mean ahhhhh Im breaking out the damn cage aghh
Hannibal Lector my American Psycho
A iller version of Ike yo
The Thriller version of Michael
My recital is as bright as the light show up at the Eiffel
A werewolf up in Paris Im livin off your vitals
I mean Ill be your con man Ill be your damn liar
Lets start the interview Ill be your vampire
I gotta feel you bite your neck to get familiar
And if you die guess what I fuckin killed you
You know what yo You a bitch
You should have a travel agent cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fucking issues you fucking bitch
I hate niggas but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me her second son
Get your mind right baby or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while Imma be rich forever
Girl seducers they come in deuces
But when I cut em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turn it to his new bitch
Im stupid but I wont get my drama on
What Im dealing with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk bout ‚Äúyou know who‚Äù I dont know who you talking bout
Unfortunately for the rest of yall
Im way better than the best of all
And even though they focus on just the flaws
They still gonna annihilate the festivals
And we still gonna sip Dom Perignon
And still gonna eat the filet mignon
Yeah yeah yeah Ive been known to cover up my eyes
With the Ray Beons
Flashing lights the stress of life
Its way too much to handle in one night
Live this life like theres no tomorrow
Wake up in Paris with a Russian model
Throw your hands in the sky
If anybody got five dollars in your pocket right now
I call this club Titanic
Why cause its going down
For all my young ladies ladies that driving Miss Daisy
Driving me crazy rock the beat baby
Hop up out the ERR she eat up the pavement
I dont give a ERR baby he crazy

Hopping out the van screams from the fans
Yeezy always knew youd be on top again
And we bout to hit Jacob the Jeweler
So I can be like Slick Rick and rule ya
Dr Martin Louis the King Junior
And Imma never let the dream turn to Kruegers
My outfit so disrespectful
You can go head and sneeze cause my presence blessed you
I mean we walked in this bitch so stylish
Niggas done mistook me for my stylist
And I know its superficial and you say its just clothes
But we shopping in that motherfucker and they just closed
So go ahead and just pose
When she walked up out the dressing room the store just froze
And I know they tryna get they cool back
And them ghetto bitches hollin How you do that
So they could never say we never lived it
And if I see Biggie tonight I loved every minute
Martin Louie the King Jr
Starting all that stunting is gonna ruin you

Maybe thats just because you aint found the right thing yeah
Lookin out my loft windows man my dreams became true
Lookin at the mirror wondering if its the same dude
Lookin at my closet wondering if its all about clothes
Look right next to me wondering if its all about
Hop in the car and asked the OnStar where this life goes

I am the generous Queen! Ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to drop "Another One", you was itchin' to scrap
You exposed your ghostwriter, now you wish it was scrapped
Heard your pussy on "Yuck," I guess you needed a Pap
What type of bum bitch shoot a friend over a rack?
What type of mother leave her one son over a stack?
Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?
"Back to Back"? Me and Drizzy laughed at that

That's why Jay ain't clear his verse for your album
Sheneneh, you a fraud committin' perjury

Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, "Man, why him?"
Like the team that I would never leave behind

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly

I wish today it will rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become Neo when they aiming at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher, more fire I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly Uh yo, yo
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocating every time it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures than they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
So we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfucking time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard your nay's become yay's

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mill' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, man, you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
'Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And you know how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked, all along
I'mma ask on the song So does she know I've been in that bed before?
A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies uh huhuh huh yo a yo

With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealin' my music,
so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod?

Sippin' champagne like soda, poppin' red bitches like cola
Trunk beat like Eardrummers

This the "You can't beat Nic" zone
Madison Square when the Knicks home

Pound the alarm! Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was o' six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I look down, yes I suppose All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
(And we know, we know) say fuck the world, we ridin' until the end
I know it's sudden, look at what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it all for you I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said, he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know, that I love him
Family ties, broken before me, niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
(And we know, we know) say fuck the world, we ridin' until the end
I know it's sudden, look at what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it all for you Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I'm love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact
I'd give it all, if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say "We did it!"
My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen, any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Jee we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is the Pinkprint All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go Light my body up I feel like we going under
Take me down
I can't help but wonder
You got everything I want and
If you keep on talking
I'mma put it where you want it
Keep up, ain't no need to slow it down
We could get it poppin'
You could love me, love me downtown
You got everything I want now
Let me fill your fantasies
And give you what you dream 'bout You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up Stakes are higher than a mother
What you wanna bet that you'll never find another?
Like me, I'm once in a lifetime
Only get all of me once in your lifetime
I'll leave you drowning in your wet dream
Swimming in that love
Surf it up in your wet dream
Baby, let me blow your cover
Come on, make me wish I was your part time lover You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me Light my body up

You see right through me.
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you You let me win,
You let me ride
You let me rock
You let me slide
And when they lookin'
You let me hide.
Defend my honor
Protect my pride.
The good advice
I always hated
But looking back
It made me greater.
You always told me
Forget the haters
Just get my money,
Just get my weight up.
Know when I'm lying,
Know when I'm crying
Its like you got it
Down to a science
Why am I trying
No you ain't buying,
I tried to fight it
Back with defiance.
You made me laugh
You make me horse
From yelling at you
And getting at you
Picking up dishes
Throwing them at you.
Why are you speaking
When no one asked you. [Chorus: x2] What are we doing,
Could you see through me?
'Cause you say Nicki
And I say who me?
And you say no you
And I say screw you.
Then you start dressing
And you start leaving
And I start crying
And I start screaming
The heavy breathing
But whats the reason.
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually fronting
I'm askin' you something
Yo, answer this question,
Class is in session,
Tired of letting
Passive aggression
Control my mind,
Capture my soul
OK your right
Just let it go.
OK you got it,
Its in the can.
Before I played it
You knew my hand.
You could turn a free throw into a goal.
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul. [Chorus: x2] Stop,
Stop,
Would you just stop looking through me
'Cause I just cant take it.
No I cant take it. You see right through me.
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you You see right through me.
(you see right through me baby)
You see right through me
You see right through me (Nicki Minaj)
I just had a epiphany,
I need to go to Tiffany's
Fendi on my slippers,
And my cookies always slippery
I don't need help,
I pay the bills on time
So I be yellin "fuck'em"
With a dildo sign
Five little mama, you a Three star
I aint sleepin when
I say I'm in my dream car
Oh did I stutta?
Harajuku hyphen,
Barbie... I'm hot
I think it's time to put the rice in
I was in the chair,
I was gluing my weave in
When you hit the stage
They was booin and leavin
Young money red flag,
No more auditions
Ask Lil Wayne who the 5 star bitch is! It was back in '07 did a couple of tapes
Did a couple DVD's made a couple mistakes
Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on a cape
Now it's which World Tour should I go on and take
See you told me I would lose but I won
I might cop a million Jimmy Choo's just for fun
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me
Australia, Sydney
Might run up in Disney, out in L.A. with Lindsey
Got the eye of the tiger, the lion of Judah
Now it's me in my time, it's just me in my prime
Everything I tried to teach 'em, they gone see it in time
Tell them bitches get a stick, I'm done leadin' the blind
Got two shows tonight, that's Brooklyn and Dallas
Then a private party at the Buckingham palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie no commercial

Now I'm sittin' at the closin' bought my mother a house
You could never understand why I grind like I do
Mikiyah and Gulani while I grind like I do
'C-c-cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was cracked
Now the whole album crack you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend, as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls, that never thought they could win
'Cause before they could begin you told 'em it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breath, tell that motherfucker say so
To all my bad bitches, I can see your halo I hear they comin' for me
Because the top is lonely

Turn me on Maybe you died 'cause everybody ask me where you at
I try to channel you in hopes that I could stare you back
But its like every intersection we just missed each otha'
You got your fans waitin' tell me you ain't six feet unda'
And tell me that you coming back that you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake
In hindsight I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge
Your earrings bamboo, your long nails too
Your B.M.W. every time you came through
You was the braveheart
You stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up
You played the same part
But I needed to grow
And I needed to know
That there were some things inside of me that I need to show
So I just deaded you
Left you in all black
But dear old Nicki
Please call back You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly I believed you
But I'm standing here calling I cant see you
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamor
Money, fame and power
'Cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour
I shoulda kept you with me gettin' at them nameless cowards
There was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground, and I was mainstream
I live the life now, that we would daydream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came yea, tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was on some stupid shit
But its still fuck the media
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you
Left you in all black
But dear old Nicki
Please call back You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly I believe you
But I'm standing here calling I cant see you
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that And yes I'm holdin you, holdin' you, holdin' you
Oh yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you

He could come inside of my play pen

Boom boom pow, this thing's so bingo
Wondering if he can understand my lingo Cause I know, he got a wife at home
But I need just one night alone
If you keep playing those good ole' games

Jimmy, Lil Swae, hoes on the chase
Cash in the air make her forget her date
Heard of my plan, she fuckin' with me anyway
If she thicky like Nicki I put that pussy on my plate
How you not notice the flyest niggas in the place?
I hit the liquid and started drippin' into space
Hublot tickin', blowin' kisses at your baby
Have fun, shotkilla like Mike reincarnated
Throwin' out a fuckin' end
I'm blowin' money in the wind
I'm sick of wearin' skinny jeans
I'm more into wearin' Louis V's
These hoes don't fuckin' listen
These niggas don't pay attention
These bitches are not yours
We keep them on all fours
Breakin' down', rollin' up potent
Sippin' champagne like soda, poppin' red bitches like cola
Trunk beat like Eardrummers
Sremm killed the haters, God bless 'em

Flyin' through the air like a fuckin' air devil
All these broke niggas just fish in a barrel

You bitches, make a nigga dick soft
Bitch ball like I'm at tip off

Rag and Bone jeans I can slip off
Bitch I've been hot since flip phones
Running this game for 5 years
Guess that's why my feet hurt
Wonder when they bite me
Do these bitches' teeth hurt?
Yes I am an icon, that's me on your T-shirt
Though you knew better
Do your fucking research
You ain't know this the no rip zone
This the "You can't beat Nic" zone
Madison Square when the Knicks home
I live next door to Brad Pitt's home
I like bad bitches, cause they like bad bitches too
I like hood niggas, with a bad attitude
They could never reach Young Nick, magnitude
Even if they had a longitude, latitude
Listen up ho, this is my territory
You are my son, like an episode of Maury
Like an episode of ER, bitch I'm hotter than the D.R
When it comes to rap skills, nobody wanna see her (seer/CR)
Motherfuckers flexin', motherfuckers acting (actors, A.R)
Bitches is my sons and they causin' contractions

Let the roof go like Cesarean
Clear my section nigga, no flexing nigga
Just a hunnid bottles they carrying
Cross the border like I lost a daughter
This foreign nigga, he ain't know better
Him pick and choose where them bullets fly
I lose the plane on this fool nigga
Bought dope with my album budget
Play Cloths was the blueprint
Four million in four seasons
Fuck who care for my fashion sense
Tell a ho come and swim in the money (Splash)
Broke niggas just stop at the heel
I could body paint you in them name brands
And put a red bow on the wheels
See I'm just in and out, I call a rent a mouth
Suck the ice out of a bezel
Use my rap persona, fuck baby mommas

I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter! They'll never thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross
Cause your spirit is ungrateful
Bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple
My career's been the pinkprint
When I retire, tell 'em think pink
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic, instinct
Oh shit, my commercial's on
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs?
Did I really prophecy every thing I do?
But before I continue let me thank my crew
So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine, Baby and Slim came
Tezz and EI told me it wouldn't be in vain
Cause prior to me signing I could've went insane
And even now I think, "Do I really want this fame?"
Let me get up and go, 700 to go overseas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm starting the show
Man, I'm birthing these artists and I'm starting to show [Chorus: x2]
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here Who I wanna work with? Nobody! 99% of them is nobody
Bitches acting like they killing shit, OK
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
Niggas spend they last dime to say the copped the soonest
Why these niggas going broke to get your approval?
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on them Ramen Noodles
B-B-B-bible, Queen is the title
And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal
And if you in the club then it's a Young Money recital
I'm just that vital, I'm busy, never idle
I'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin' idol
Pink Friday in Macy's, thongs and some pasties
(Yo, what other female rapper perfume in here? Cause I must've missed it)
12 milli to kick my feet up, get ready this is the Re-up [Chorus] Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide
What you hiding from? What you hiding from?
Hiding baby Would you, would you, give your
Would you, would you, give your
Would you, would you, give your all for yours [Chorus] [Nicki Minaj:]

Young Money. [Chorus] If you could you would get rid of me,
F*** you gone do when a b**** try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard.
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne.
I done put the choke hold on now
They screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I'm Still the one to beat.
Ain't in a rush from these streets
I am the streets. I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard Carter called, lemme get the car key, you don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquis, everything sparkly (man man down! ) hit em on a walkie-talkie.
Hit em, hit em knock-knock, tell em let me in. my name ring bells b**** buzz me in
And I only stop for pedestrians, or real real bad lesbian.
Hit em wit the Mac, hit em wit the Tech 9, hit em wit the Ruger by the intersex sine. hit em wit a Tommy so my n****s call me Pammy and I always the jammy in the trunk or in the lamby
Put my whole burrough on my back and I'm gooda, I don't wanna hear what you would, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up, used to drink water wit a little bit of sugar.
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups, doin' the scissor-leg on the mat wit my foot up.
Young black pin-up, all of my b****es did up, now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up.
And I'm tellin' President Carter he picked a winner, b****es like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma
These birds all fly south in the winter, f*** I look like chompin' on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle; I'ma be a queen no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle, Louis on the duffel. I'm a bad b**** no muzzle. (no muzzle).
B****es is softer than Al Dante, cut from a different kentae. tell em I'm the ninja,
Weezy is my sensei. so I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter. gimme my chopsticks
I'll have the rap b****es for dinner.
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups and khakis
This is for my n**** 7-up in Castaki
This is for my n****s wheeling them Kawasakis
Shout out to the back east salt fish eggs
Kisses is to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda c***y.
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky.
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinski.
Pumps on the clutch, right hand on the six-speed.
Write my own raps I gotta go, I gotta get me (gotta get me.)
Oh [Chorus] If you could you would get rid of me,
F*** you gone do when a b**** try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard.
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne.
I done put the choke on now
They screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I will, I gots to win.
I'm still lookin' around for my
Competition, I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard From slap-and-cry you start to die, so I must go harder.
Gotta make these b****es know me just like Bobby know water.
Better yet, like Bubba, know shrimp. but he don't say s***
When the gun on his lip, and I don't say s*** put the gun
On my hip. so I don't say s*** but the gun on my hip.
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship
Check out how them b****es just run on my dick
And me, I'm that nasty son of a b****.
I still got that b**** cum on my lips
It yee ain got money, don't come on my strip
And if ya got money, don't come on my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic, but I can still
Make you tumble and flip
You f***in' wit me if you f***in' wit Nick
They ain't f***in' wit me ,they ain't f***in' wit Nick
Your girlfriend and she just split
'cause she wanna f*** me and she wanna f*** Nick
They wonder if he be f***in' Nick, as long as she be f***in' rich
That's why I keep my luggage 'cause, I swear y'all's a f***in' trip.
Young Money Dungeon, b****. my swagger is just punching b****
And I shoot like I'm from over-seas, so call my gun, "Gunovich"
Weezy F. Baby and the "F" is for a bunch of s***
Red drank, blue pill, white dust
Yes I love my country b****. [Chorus] Wish you could get rid of Young Money,
F*** you gone do when a b**** try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard.
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne.

Rich friday Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, caught cagin' doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs Are you alone?
Do you need someone? Is it too late to talk?
Did I wait too long?
Thousand words
Don't change a thing
Is it only three?
Three words that you're missing? Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know Hoo, hoo
We're 'bout to play here
We're 'bout to play here
Hoo, hoo
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no easy cash, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna, guess I wanna imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it How come you never show it?
All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and be loved
(To love and to be loved) I'm losin' a thing
I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone
'Cause the tears don't end Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know Hoo, hoo
We're 'bout to play here
We're 'bout to play here
Hoo, hoo
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo I think I gave him a discrete name; he replied with a street name
P.R. at the heat game, no ball, repeat game
He addicted to hustle; I'm addicted to fame
Though he packin' that muscle, I'm addicted to brain
I'm addicted to chilling, make a hell of a killing
Don't I stunt on these bitches? Man I'm bad as a villain
Get the gun, I'ma hunt 'em, when I'm done, I'm a don 'em
When we leaving the lounge, I'ma keep it a hundred
It went down, enough said, pull off in that thing, and it's blush red Sex in the lounge, girl, I'm gon' take ya down
I'm gon' have you screaming, girl, they gonna hear the sound
Of our sex in the lounge

Fuck with me, turn around and bust it open for me
Get on that dick and get that money, go Oprah for me

My body's callin' for you I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day (Night and day)
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly hoo See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, ho oh If I can see it hoo, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
Oh, I believe I can fly hoo Hey, 'cause I believe in me, oh If I can see it hoo, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it hey I believe I can fly hoo
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away

And together we will get through these times [Bridge:]
And we will cry together
And we'll fight this together
And we'll be strong together
Stand together, pray together [Chorus:]
Rise up, when you feel you can't go on
Rise up, when all of your hope is gone
Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong
Rise, rise up
Rise up, and when the tears start to fall
Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all
Rise up, when your back is up against the wall
Rise, rise up Now I know the burdens that you've had
And you don't think nobody cares
A storm comes out of nowhere
And you're feeling like it just ain't fair
Not here to preach about the private side, no
'Cause I understand and now is not the time
See I just wanna help you make it right
Walk with you, holding the candle light [Bridge] [Chorus] You see struggle so hard

'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound
Somethings goin' on upstairs, yeah

And I just can't believe this shit I ran downstairs lookin' the closet lookin' for that who
Said a prayer 'cause only God knows what I'm gonna do

Who would have thought she was creepin' with another man
The down low happened to me all over again And then I turned the TV down
'Cause I know I heard a squeaky sound
Somethin' goin' on upstairs, yeah
'Cause I know that no one else lives here Bomp, bomp, bomp
As I get closer to the stair ways, all I hear

Sexy lady, drive me crazy, drive me wild I was in a tunnel
And couldn't see the light
And whenever I'd look up
I couldn't see the sky
Sometimes when I'm standin'
It seems like I done walked for miles
And my heart could be cryin'
Dead in the middle of a smile But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
Heard a small voice sayin' The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free, whoa Now in the midst of my battle
All hope was gone
Downtown in a rushed crowd
And felt all alone
And every now and then
I felt like I would lose my mind
I've been racin' for years
And still no finish line, oh But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains (mountains)
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
And then a small voice sayin' The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free Somehow my beginning stepped right in (right in)
Then faith became my friend (my friend)
And now I can depend
On the voices of the wind
When it's sayin' (sayin') The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me) Won't you come and set me free
Won't you set me free The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Won't you come and set me free, yeah yeah
Won't you come and set me free, hey (It's like) It's like, I can see the light, shinin'!
Somewhere beyond the clouds
It's like, I can see the light, shinin'!
Take it down, down
Down on me, looks like, I can see the light, shinin'!
Fear is going, the world's turnin'
The clouds movin, the sun shinin'
(If that guy can see the light, shine it!)
The rain is gone, I made it home
Rainbow, pot of gold (The storm is over now)
I'm tellin' you I could see the light
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven over me, yeah
(Heaven is over me) Come and set me free
Come and set me free
Won't you come and set me free, yeah
(The storm is over now)
(Somewhere beyond the clouds) I am a mountain,
I am a tall tree, oh
I am a swift wind
Sweeping the country I am a river,
Down in the valley, oh
I am a vision
And I can see clearly If anybody asks you who I am, just stand up tall, look 'em in the face and say I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high

(He's the greatest)At the end of the tunnel
(Can you feel it?)Believe in a pot of gold
(He's the greatest)At the end of a rainbow How did I ever let you slip away
Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more
Ever since you closed the door If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine Funny, funny how time goes by
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye
Why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering
When every day I pray please come back to me If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine And you had enough love for the both of us
But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back)
Never do you wrong (If I could turn back)
And never leave your side (If I could turn back)
If I could turn back the hands There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you
(If I could turn back)
Forever honest and true to you
(If I could turn back)
If you accept me back in your heart, I love you
(If I could turn back the hands) (If I could turn back)
That would be my will
(If I could turn back)
Darlin' I'm begging you to take me by the hands
(If I could turn back the hands) I'm going down, yes I am
(If I could turn back)
Down on my bended knee, yeah
(If I could turn back)
And I'm gonna be right there until you return to me
(If I could turn back the hands) (If I could turn back)
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall

To every city

Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block
Ghetto America! Rollin' through the hood
Just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know
Your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride (With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish Now ever since this money come
It's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin', this real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't want to raise the roof
Until my shit is going down And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride (With you)
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
(With you)
And how I used to club hop on weekends
(With you)
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn, my condolences I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies now
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion men? And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride (With you)
How I used to street perform on Friday
(With you)
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday
(With you)
Standing here throwing them songs at me
Somebody pray for me I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face

No mountain's too high for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith
No river's too wide for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray [R Kelly]
And then you will see the morning will come
and everyday will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
I just want you to see [Chorus: Celine Dion & R. Kelly]
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your Angel,
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your Angel, I'm your Angel [R Kelly]
I saw your tear drops and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way
Let me show you a better day [Celine Dion]
And then you will see, the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears just cast them on me
How can I make you see [Chorus] [R Kelly]
And when it's time to face the storm [Celine Dion]
I'll be right by your side [R Kelly]
Grace will keep us safe and warm
And I know we will survive [Celine Dion]

Saying "damn" to myself
I should have known the day would come
That she would find somebody else
And all the things I took her through
Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long
Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone 'Cause when a woman's fed up
No matter how you beg, no
It ain't nothing you can do about it (nothing you can do about it)
It's like running out of love
No matter what you say, no
And then it's too late to talk about it (too late to talk about it) Now let's talk about how it all goes down
I used to make love to you daily
When the night fell, the same
And anytime that you were hurt
I could feel your pain
And if I had a dollar
It was yours, yeah (ooh, yeah)
And whenever we would go out
I would front the bill
But now the up is down
And the silence is sound
I hurt you too, too many times
Now I can't come around 'Cause when a woman's fed up
No matter how you beg, no
It ain't nothing you can do about it (nothing you can do about it)
Oh no, it's just like running out of love
No matter what you say, no
And then it's too late to talk about it (too late to talk about it) Oh yeah, oh yeah, la la da da
La
La da da da da
La da da da da
La
Oh yeah, la da da da da
La
Oh, ah, listen, if you don't want to find out the hard way
Then listen to this song while the record plays When a woman's fed up
Mama taught me along time ago
It ain't nothing you can do about it (nothing you can do about it)
Oh no, it's like running out of love
No matter what you say, no
Then it's too late to talk about it (too late to talk about it) Yeah
You can cry a river
'Till an ocean starts to form, yeah
But she will always remember
'Cause she's a woman scorned
And if you ever get her back
It will never be the same
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes
Every time she see your face
Now your trust is out the door
She don't want you no more
You used to tell your boys, not me
And she would always be there for you
If you had took the time to see
What that woman meant to you
Is what the mirror said to me, whoa
She was raised in Illinois
Right outside of Chicago
Some of the best cookin' you ever had
Yes, it was and I miss her
Hey woman, if you're listening
Said I miss you baby, whoa, whoa, oh yeah When a woman loves
She, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real She took me back
After I broke her heart
About a thousand times
She gave her life to me
With no regrets, she followed me
And she, and she, the girl she raised me
And I'm forever indebted, and I'm forever indebted,
I'm forever indebted to her cause When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real She filled my soul
With the very touch of her hand
She really did
And she's got more, more faith in me than a beach got sand
And I like to tell her, I like to tell her, that I'm forever indebted,
That I'm forever indebted, forever indebted to her cause When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real
Yea, yea See a woman love
It would never die young
Even when I'm dead and gone,
I'm gonna love her from the sky, yea

BARACK OBAMA:
In small towns and big cities
We came together
As democrats, republicans, and independents
To stand up and say that we are
ONE NATION, we are ONE PEOPLE
And our time for changed has COME.. R. KELLY:
When the mountain seems too high
And you don't have the courage nor the strength to climb
And the road you're on won't end
But still you run though you cannot see the finish line And dark clouds are over you
Your skies no longer blue
But you marched on straight ahead
Somehow you made it through Got to the mountain peek
They left a path of me
Your victory made history and now CHORUS:
I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh I When it felt like you were weak
And couldn't fight no more
On the ropes and it seemed like
You was gonna run out of breathe When the world was on your shoulder
And the walls were in your way
You leaped and made it over
Through it all you kept the faith With hope you set us free
You showed us how to dream
And now we can lift our voices
And forever sing Now the time to look ahead
And thank our heroes of the past
And celebrate this victory
Let's raise the flag cause CHORUS:
I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh I BRIDGE:
And when they tried to keep you down
You kept up your head
Never losing sight
You believed in what was right You endured to the end
Walked through the strongest wind
The storms over
And a new day begins And when our hope was dying
You brought us healing
And now I got something
To tell my children CHORUS:
I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh I Baby you are the song of my life
And the sweetest melody
And I love making love to your eyes
It's like singing in the perfect key You are my number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
You are my number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit I got a studio up in heaven
And it's the perfect atmosphere
It's guaranteed to make you platinum
All you gotta do is come here Let me make you my number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit The way you put your music on me
Symphony should be your name
It's like God gave me the perfect echo
When he sent your love my way You are my number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit New York to L.A. then press on to Rome
L.A. then Vegas then press our way home
Our music plays all around the world
And my life has been a smash since you became My number one hit As I lay me down
Heaven hear me now
I'm lost without a cause
After giving it my all Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to I look to you
I look to you After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong I look to you
I look to you Yeah And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song I look to you, you About to lose my breathe,
There's no more fighting left,
I'm sinking to rise no more,
Searching for that open door, door Every road that I've taken
Lead to my regret.
I don't know if I'm going to make it.
Nothing to do but lift my head I look to you.
I look to you.
After all my strength is gone,
In you I can be strong
I look to you.
I look to you.
And when melodies are gone,
In you I hear a song.
I look to you (Whitney)
We love you Whitney, rest in peace What's up baby?

And the rays from the sun wakes me
I'm stretchin' and yawnin'
In a bed that don't belong to me
And a voice yells, "Good morning, darlin", from the bathroom
Then she comes out and kisses me
And to my surprise, she ain't you Now I've got this dumb look on my face
Like, what have I done?
How could I be so stupid to be have laid here til the morning sun?
Lost the track of time
Oh, what was on my mind?
From the club, went to her home
Didn't plan to stay that long Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes
Searching for my car keys
Tryin' to get on up out the door
Then she stretched her hands in front of it
Said, "You can't go this way"
Looked at her, like she was crazy
Said, "Woman move out my way"
Said, "I got a wife at home"
She said, "Please don't go out there"
"Lady, I've got to get home"
She said, her husband was comin' up the stairs "Shh, shh, quiet
Hurry up and get in the closet"
She said, "Don't you make a sound
Or some shit is going down"
I said, "Why don't I just go out the window?"
"Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor"
"Shit think, shit think, shit quick, put me in the closet"
And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin' to figure out
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house Then he walks in and yells, "I'm home"
She says, "Honey, I'm in the room"
Walks in there with a smile on his face
Sayin', "Honey, I've been missin' you"
She hops all over him
And says, "I've cooked and ran your bath water?
I'm tellin' you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar Throws her in the bed
And start to snatchin' her clothes off
I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on?
You're not gonna believe it
But things get deeper as the story goes on
Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone
I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate
But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late
He hopped up and said, "There's a mystery going on
And I'm gonna solve it"
And I'm like, "God please, don't let this man open this closet? He walks in the bathroom
And looks behind the door
She says, "Baby, come back to bed"
He says, "Bitch say no more"
He pulls back the shower curtain
While she's biting her nails
Then he walks back to the room
Right now, I'm sweating like hell
Checks under the bed
Then under the dresser
He looks at the closet
I pull out my Beretta
He walks up to the closet
He goes up to the closet
Now he's at the closet
Damn he's opening the closet? i need an angel i'm calling an angel send me an angel now Had the landlord at my door
I heard him saying,
Tomorrow no more
Pay me now or leave
But we didn't have anything to give(ah can you feel me) Searching for restoration(and we need restoration)
Make the church my family
This is my story
This is my song
And I can sing it all night long I tell you why because, [Chorus] The ghetto is a part of my religion(the only thing my eyes can see)
The only thing my eyes can see(and I tell you there ain't no man)
There ain't no man gonna stop the vision(I'm a part of the ghetto)
The ghetto is a part of me Children cry no more(children cry no more)
Because heaven is upon you
Please put down your guns
And we shall overcome Thought your load may be heavy
Know that the weight makes you strong
Take my life for example
While I sing my song
Mr. Kelly help me sing this song [Chorus X2] La la la la la lala la..X3 (fade out)
The ghetto is a part of me
The ghetto is a part of my religion [Celine Dion]
No mountain's too high for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith
No river's too wide for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray [R Kelly]
And then you will see the morning will come
and everyday will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
I just want you to see [Chorus: Celine Dion & R. Kelly]
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your Angel,
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your Angel, I'm your Angel [R Kelly]
I saw your tear drops and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way
Let me show you a better day [Celine Dion]
And then you will see, the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears just cast them on me
How can I make you see [Chorus] [R Kelly]
And when it's time to face the storm [Celine Dion]
I'll be right by your side [R Kelly]
Grace will keep us safe and warm
And I know we will survive [Celine Dion]
And when it seems as if your end is drawing near (end is drawing near)
Don't you dare give up the fight
Just put your trust beyond the skies [Chorus: Repeats] [Chorus]
This is my song for real no doubt
See the DJ is making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to dance floor
We begin to dance slow

Sprayed on these blocks
Moved in on these blocks
Went out on these blocks

Been watched on these blocks Yeah you know I walk
Through the valley of these blocks
I shall not fear these blocks
Because I run these blocks, yeah (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)

And I'm [Chorus] Now I believe the day will come
When my heart will decide to change
But until then
See everything will remain the same [Chorus] See sometimes I gotta tell myself

To keep surviving
And no matter what the cause

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up) Now usually I leave the club with a girl who has a man
And take her to a hotel for just a one night stand
See, I'm a playa so I ain't tryna take her on no dates
But much like my Patron, man, I'm just tryna take it straight Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty
The sweetest girl in the world and I mean it and on top of that she's a cutie
I ain't seen nothin' like her around here in a while
And if I had a girl she'd be the one to bear my child Tellin' myself I'm a playa so I keep tryna shake it off
But I keep on seein' this big old house with a picket fence and a dog
Never felt nothin' like this, she's more than a mistress

And girl, well, it's about makin' love If you choose me I guarantee

Can we say a prayer together baby
Heavenly Father which art in heaven
I pray that you keep this love together
This is my prayer, baby, baby, baby, I love you I was riding in my car one day
In the express lane rollin on the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings then I
Reached down beside me then i look
On the floor felt on the backseat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before i knew it
Here comes this truck now Doctor said don't think he gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said told me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
Now for ten years i've been straight You saved me [4x]
Gave me a second chance
You saved me [3x]
You saved me Now i've been sitting in this chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God that someone will call
Me with a job opening
Cause it's been so hard for me
Month to month struggling to eat
But still there was no answer
I stop believing in his word and
Got so mad at him and
When somebody said God's good
I just laugh at 'em But in the nick of time his blessing
Rain on me
By his grace the phone ring
A lady said were hiring and
That's when I knew You saved me [4x] Now i was 18 out there on the block
Selling drugs
With a gun at my waist
And for people I had no love
See the streets was my home
Family and friends were all gone
Had no one to trust
And deep inside i was all alone
And a deal went bad one day
And it was enough to pause me
I was shot 4 times and before i
Knew it I was on my knees Blood pushin out my body
My heart's beating faster don't know what i'm gonna do
I don't think i'm gonna last then
I begain to flash back on the things
I done in my past
Then I heard a small voice that said
I'll give you peace if you believe
I accepted Christ that day
Halilujah now i'm free You saved me [4x] I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering
Where did it come from (I got tested)
And the results came back
And the doctor said i'm sorry but u got cancer
I could not beleive it so
I call my mama to calm my nerves (mama) she got down on her knees
(mama) she said a prayer for me
(mama) just keep on thanking Jesus
(mama) he'll give you what you need
(thank you Jesus)
Now that was five years ago
I don't have that pain no more
Doc said you can go home
Cause all your cancer's gone You saved me [4x] You saved me (said you saved me)
You saved me (but you saved me)
You saved me saaaved me
Gave me a second chance (second chance)
Halilujah saved me
Saved me saved me
Wooooooh You saved me You gave me it was by grace You saved me
I'm so thankful that You looked down on me
Saw me standing there
I was at the end of my rope no where to go
And you gave me No where to go (and you saved me)
I was down and out 2
I was doing drugs 2
I was running the streets 2
Never felt love
I was wilding out
You saved me
You stepped in ooh save me You saved me Welcome to the quiet before the storm
No worries, love
Oh yeah, ain't no pressure

The love she's given me
Makes it easy to do a song like this
So this one's for you ma

We learned the holy story

Don't you know we love you sweet Sadie
Place no one above you sweet Sadie
Well well well (living in the past) Sometimes it seems so funny
No money can turn your life around
Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papas' old brandy
Always that needed smile
Once in awhile she would break down and cry Sometimes she'd be so happy
Being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds with just a simple song Oh Sadie maiden
She's loving my song in a special way
Well, well, well
Sweet Sadie
Living in the past Oh she's never sinning
In love she's always winning yeah

It's a mean world without you
And I surely miss you much mother And now that you're gone

'Cause your're cryin' lady, woah Sadie

Sometimes when I'm standin'
It seems like I done walked for miles
And my heart could be cryin'
Dead in the middle of a smile But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
Heard a small voice sayin' The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free, whoa Now in the midst of my battle
All hope was gone
Downtown in a rushed crowd
And felt all alone
And every now and then
I felt like I would lose my mind
I've been racin' for years
And still no finish line, oh But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains (mountains)
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
And then a small voice sayin' The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free Somehow my beginning stepped right in (right in)
Then faith became my friend (my friend)
And now I can depend
On the voices of the wind
When it's sayin' (sayin') The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah

Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!)
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!) I was riding in my car one day
In the express lane rollin on the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings then I
Reached down beside me then i look
On the floor felt on the backseat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before i knew it
Here comes this truck now Doctor said don't think he gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said told me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
Now for ten years i've been straight You saved me [4x]
Gave me a second chance
You saved me [3x]
You saved me Now i've been sitting in this chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God that someone will call
Me with a job opening
Cause it's been so hard for me
Month to month struggling to eat
But still there was no answer
I stop believing in his word and
Got so mad at him and
When somebody said God's good
I just laugh at 'em But in the nick of time his blessing
Rain on me
By his grace the phone ring
A lady said were hiring and
That's when I knew You saved me [4x] Now i was 18 out there on the block
Selling drugs
With a gun at my waist
And for people I had no love
See the streets was my home
Family and friends were all gone
Had no one to trust
And deep inside i was all alone
And a deal went bad one day
And it was enough to pause me
I was shot 4 times and before i
Knew it I was on my knees Blood pushin out my body
My heart's beating faster don't know what i'm gonna do
I don't think i'm gonna last then
I begain to flash back on the things
I done in my past
Then I heard a small voice that said
I'll give you peace if you believe
I accepted Christ that day
Halilujah now i'm free You saved me [4x] I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering
Where did it come from (I got tested)
And the results came back
And the doctor said i'm sorry but u got cancer
I could not beleive it so
I call my mama to calm my nerves (mama) she got down on her knees
(mama) she said a prayer for me
(mama) just keep on thanking Jesus
(mama) he'll give you what you need
(thank you Jesus)
Now that was five years ago
I don't have that pain no more
Doc said you can go home
Cause all your cancer's gone You saved me [4x] You saved me (said you saved me)
You saved me (but you saved me)
You saved me saaaved me
Gave me a second chance (second chance)
Halilujah saved me
Saved me saved me
Wooooooh You saved me You gave me it was by grace You saved me
I'm so thankful that You looked down on me
Saw me standing there
I was at the end of my rope no where to go
And you gave me No where to go (and you saved me)
I was down and out 2
I was doing drugs 2
I was running the streets 2
Never felt love
I was wilding out
You saved me
You stepped in ooh save me You saved me You remind me of something

Summertime and just talk about just making it
You know what I'm saying being successful
Following up our dreams you know and I
I believe that's every kids dream
You know what I'm saying to rise and
Be somebody but damn!
Sometimes we just get caught up I ain't got no money
And I ain't got no friends
Looks like my world is coming to an end
No food on the table, no clothes on my back
No shoes on my feet and
I just bearly got a used Cadillac
Now ain't that ghetto for ya
But somehow it's gotta change yeah
Ghetto for ya
So I took this remix and
Rearranged gotham city [Chorus]
City of love a city of peace
For everyone of us
'Cause we all need it,
Can't live without it
Gotham city for the ghetto yeah! Gotham city for the ghetto,
That's what I'm talking 'bout
Ghetto fabulous, to a nigga health be hazardous
If you wanna test raffishness for the respect
S.T.R.I.N.G.S. Yes. (oh yeah)
Fuck the rest give me the best
Why should I have to settle for less
When I could push the V-12's with finesse
(scratching) and all that mess
If you try to hold me back
Would I keep on struggling till I hit the sky.
Even if you wanted to you can't deny
Gotta feed baby girl who would die We keep talking about escalating
Well who's gonna go first
Guess I'll be the one to step up
If you don't follow me it would be the worst
Every time something goes down
Somebody's crying ghetto tears
Hope I'm not raining on your parade
But this is not what keeping it really is
Now ain't that ghetto for ya
But somehow it's gotta change yeah!
Ghetto for ya,
So I took this remix and rearranged
A gotham city [Chorus] Check it out
Now motherfucker wanna act surprised
'Cause you're afraid to change scared to rise
That's why you ass get left behind
They got a sight, they got a mind
'Cause ain't nobody gonna stop the dream

Negativity you gotta let go
Heaven gotta see for the ghetto We all need hey hey hey

Prayer changes things Now I was in a real bad abusive relationship
Knowing that, that was no way for me to live
A young girl like me, raised up in a good family
Way too young to endure such misery
And every night I cry myself to sleep from all the pain
And the more I prayed for sunny days it seemed to rain
(He hit me) at any given time
(He hit me) no reason at all
(He hit me) so so hard
(He hit me) my God, sometimes I'd fall
Mama asked what happened to me
And I'd take up for him
She said that devil's a liar
And pray get rid of him
And now I'm going to school, hitting those books
I'm doing fine
He's out my life, I'm not confused
Got peace of mind, man I tell you Prayer changes (it changes)
Prayer changes (oh it changes)
Prayer changes (I'm a witness that)
Prayer changes things (said I know)
Prayer changes (it changes)
Prayer changes (it changes)
Prayer changes (I'm a living witness that)
Prayer changes things I was a freshman in college and uh
I had just made it on the basketball team
I had all the skills it took to make it
But on my grades I would get nothing but all D's
And the coach came to me and had a talk with me about my career
Said if you don't get your grades up
I'm gonna have to sit you down this year
Man as tough as I was I brake down and cry 'cause
Everybody knows me, knows that basketball is my life
(Algebra) I studied hard
(Chemistry) I gave my all
(Calculus) oh my God
(English) so many flaws
Playing ball didn't look to good for me
My future, could not see
I had lost all my beliefs
And gave up on all my dreams
Then I went to church on Sunday
And the pastor began to preach
It was like he was talking to me
When he said I can do all things
In Christ that strengthens me
And for me that was enough
Now that I went from a D all the way to an A plus
I tell you prayer changes things Prayer changes
Prayer changes (prayer)
Prayer changes (it changes things)
Prayer changes things (oh)
Prayer changes (said it changes)
Prayer changes (things)

Prayer changes things Me and my wife had a few problems
We thought that nothing could solve them
Listening to family members and so called friends
Man I tell you that's just how the devil creeps in (oh yes it is)
We were separated at least for a month or two
She was wilding in the clubs
And I was out there doing wrong too
And we would walk around the house
Putting each other down
I mean right in front of the kids
We would curse each other out
Then I was in a bad accident
And almost lost my life
And guess who was there for me
My wife
Now ain't it funny how He makes a way
When we said there was no way
I'm out the hospital and back at home
Planning another wedding day, I tell you Prayer changes (it changes)

Prayer changes things (things, I'm a witness that)
Prayer changes (change)
Prayer changes (prayer changes)
Prayer changes (prayer changes)
Prayer changes things Now all of these things were happening in one family
But that's okay, 'cause there's nothing God can't achieve
I don't care what the problem in your life may be
'Cause who the Son sets free, is free indeed
And if you didn't know, now you should know
All you gotta do is take this family's life for example
Now Mom and Dad are married again
Four kids now, 'cause they just had twins
Little sister all grown up now
She's a lawyer, married with one child now
Two years, big brother's out of college
And man he's got his hands full (hallelujah)
Blessed with skills, blessed with knowledge
Now he's playing for the Chicago Bulls Prayer changes (I'm a witness yeah)

But still I got my head up just like I promised you
Every since you left your baby, boy's been dealin' with
Problem after problem, tell me what am I supposed to do
See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place
Look in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face
And then my tears roll down and hit the sink
Then I hold my head up high, I hope the Man upstairs can hear my cry
All these questions deep inside my mind
Like if Jesus loved me, why he leave my side, mama
I'm still tryin' to get the answer why
You were young, 45, and you had to die
I'm always tryin' to help people out
And it's them same people tryin' to take food out my mouth (Fo' real tho') It seems like the more money I make
(Fo' real tho') The more drama y'all try to create
(Fo' real tho') And through I try to move into the positive
(Fo' real tho') The more y'all don't want to let me live When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin'
Need to get up off your butt and go get your own somethin'
I'm pullin' on my hair to keep from snappin' off
Fools ride up in my camp and be actin' off
Somebody out there please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it out Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me and lift me up, oh, yeah I gave 13 years of my life to this industry
Hit song or not, I've given all of me
You smile in my face and tell me that you love
But then before you know the truth, you're so quick to judge me
That's alright, go ahead, keep talkin'
'Cause I'ma hold my head up high and keep walkin'
And reach for the sky, focus on the plan
Rescue the kid with his paper a pen
And this is for the homies that we lost
Yo', we cannot forget y'all, so the hats come off
We pour a little liquor out for the memory
I know y'all up there sittin' on chrome in them pearly streets
The street survivors before careful, stay alive
I'm prayin' for your families, I hope you pray for mine (Fo' real tho') Used to be a time you wished me well
(Fo' real tho') It hurts to know you want to see me fail
(Fo' real tho') And don't forget I kept you out of jail
(Fo' real tho') Where's my arms when you needed to be held They turn they backs on you, who was there believin'
Who said your troubles were only for a season
In church together tryin' to pick up all the pieces
And now you betray me, I bind you in the name of Jesus
Somebody please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it all out Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
(Please shower down)
So shower down on me, wet me with your love (Yeah)
I need you to take me and lift me up (Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah) Man, I tell you it's enough to make you want to give it up
Thank God for my fans 'cause through it all they show me love
To my sister and to brothers
Tell me why can't we just try to get along with one another
And stop hurtin' one another, fightin' one another
Man, I pray to God He get my family back together
Let me see what want to see, just to blind me
All of these luxuries, wine and dining
And then You push me out in front to get behind me
Then You sat me up by blessin' me to bind me
I'm a grown man with kids now, stakes are high
Gotta go to church now to avoid the fight
Frankly, y'all to keep it real I'm just tired
Have dreams of bein' dead, but the devil is alive (Fo' real tho') Church folks, you need to stop judgin'
(Fo' real tho') Or you will be the first to be judged
(Fo' real tho') And women stop dependin' on us men
(Fo' real tho') And start dependin' on the Man above, feel me And as for robbin', here's what I need to do
Get rid of them clowns and get myself a whole 'nother crew
Media, do your job
But please just don't make my job so hard
Somebody please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm still young tryin' to figure it all out Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me (Shower down on me now), wet me with your love
I need you to take me (Please) and lift me up, yeah,
Yeah (Said I'm callin' on heaven) Heaven, I need a hug

Like an eagle when it soars in the sky Out of all the girls I've loved before
Out of all the stages I've performed on
Out of all of the cities I've been to
I bless the day that I found you I bless the day I found you and that's my word
It's nothing for me out there in those streets
You took my heart and you set it on fire
And now my love forever burns
You keep taking me higher [Chorus]
I been looking for love
In all the wrong places
And now I finally found
Someone who cares for me
No matter the storm
It was you who helped me face it
And now it's safe to say
That you really care for me Just like the wings
You took me, flew me away, yeah
And now my ground is underneath my feet
This man had nowhere to go
Then you gave me direction
And now the rest of my days
I can't help but give you the praise [Chorus] You saw my needs, forgave my faults
You cleansed my heart, you changed my thoughts
You brought the sun into my life
When my world had seemed dark, yes you did
And you're the only one
Who was there when I needed a friend
You're the only one who can place joy
When there's pain in my heart [Chorus] la la la la la la la la la Anticipate you grace to stage

See girl, only thing I'm trying to establish with you is not
Who's right or who's wrong, but what's right and what's wrong
Real talk

Sitting in VIP, smoking and drinking and kicking it, tell me girl Did she say there were other guys there?
Did she say there were other guys there?
Were there other guys there?

I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt n Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack Mr Magic Marley Marl
I let my tape rock til my tape popped
Smokin weed and Bambu sippin on Private Stock
Way back when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin Duke duhha duhha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far

Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the east coast
Condos in Queens indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin life without fear
Puttin karats in my baby girls ears
Lunches brunches interviews by the pool
Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And its still all good
Uh and if you dont know now you know niXga You know very well who you are
Dont let em hold you down reach for the stars
You had a few but not that many
Cause youre the only one Ill give you good and plenty Super Nintendo Sega Genesis

Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live if Im just living to die Check it I grew up a fuckin screwup
Got introduced to the game got a ounce and fuckin blew up
Choppin rocks overnight
The niXga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missing
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that niXga Im too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
Thats why I bust back it dont phase me
When he drop take his Glock and Im Swayze
Celebrate my escape sold the Glock bought some weight
Lay back I got some money to make motherfucker And I wonder if theyll laugh when Im dead
Why am I fighting to live if Im just living to fight
Why am I trying to see when there aint nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live if Im just living to die Its on me
But still Im having memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh pushing the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb but we had heart
In the dark will we survive through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies now the whole worlds trying to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me so what can I do
But stay true sipping s of brew
And now media is trying to test me
Got the press asking questions trying to stress me
Misery is all I see thats my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes slipped got arrested and flipped
He screamed thug life and emptied the clip
Got tired of running from the police And I wonder if theyll laugh when Im dead
Why am I fighting to live if Im just living to fight
Why am I trying to see when there aint nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live if Im just living to die Good evenin ladies and gentlemen
Hows everybody doin tonight

Loungin black smoking sacks up in acts
And sidekicks with my sidekicks rocking fly kicks

BIG bring that booty to me Chorus until fade
Its the ten crack commandments what
NiXga cant tell me nothing about this coke
Cant tell me nothing about this crack this weed my hustlin niXgas
NiXgas on the corner I aint forget you niXgas my triple beam niXgas Ive been in this game for years it made me an animal
Its rules to this shit I wrote me a manual
A stepbystep booklet for you to get
Your game on track not your wig pushed back
Rule Number Uno never let no one know
How much dough you hold cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy specially
If that man fucked up get yo ass stuck up
Number never let em know your next move
Dont you know Bad Boys move in silence and violence
Take it from your highness
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for their bricks and chips
Number never trust nobody
Your momsll set that ass up properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up shit for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number I know you heard this before
Never get high on your own supply
Number never sell no crack where you rest at
I dont care if they want a ounce tell em bounce
Number that goddamn credit Dead it
You think a crackhead paying you back shit forget it
this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood dont mix like dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number never keep no weight on you
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number shoulda been Number to me
If you aint gettin bagged stay the fuck from police
If niXgas think you snitchin they aint trying to listen
They be sittin in your kitchen waiting to start hittin
Number a strong word called consignment
Strictly for live men not for freshmen
If you aint got the clientele say hell no
Cause they gon want they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules youll have mad bread to break up
If not years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jake up heard in three weeks
She sniffed a whole half of cake up
Heard she suck a good dick and can hook a steak up
Gotta go gotta go more pies to bake up word up Dont stop Im not finished yet
Dont stop Im not finished yet
Dont stop Im not finished yet
Dont stop Im not finished yet Dont stop Im not finished yet
Dont stop Im not finished yet
Dont stop Im not finished yet
Dont stop Im not finished yet Do you ever ask yourself when are they ever gonna stop
Do you ever ask yourself when are they gonna stop making those hits
Do you ever ask yourself when are they gonna stop making us dance
Do you ever ask yourself
When those bad boy are gonna stop making all this money I lick shots at intruders
Take the coke money and invest in computers
Tryin to reach the next level Rolex with the ice bezel
Coming through the ghetto in a Porsche Carrero But for now Ill play the back of the cruiser
Light another sack for the three time losers
Pour out some beer bust out the ruger
Ladies and gentleman Bullets will leave you tremblin
Shooken up

We got it all from Heron to Fishscale New York to Ismail get locked Im gettin bail
My style is flashy like a fiver strobes
Going around the globe hunnies wearing silk robes
Time to flip the script bust the whip Legend with the chip dark blue with my trunk dipped
To the feds catch me if you can
Im a still transport with my man on the Peter Pan
Get there and bury the bricks in the sand They think I want a tan Im sittin on a hundred grand

Drove down the block stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes

Im livin everyday like a hustle another drug to juggle
another day another struggle
I dont wanna live no mo
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do
Im livin everyday like a hustle another drug to juggle
another day another struggle I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers mad buddha abuser
But they dont know about your stressfilled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
Thats why you drink Tanqueray so you can reminisce
and wish you wasnt livin so devilish ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew flippin over s
Cause GED wasnt BIG
I got PAID thats why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
for chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they dont know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasnt tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newports cause Im due in court
for an assault that I caught in Bridgeport New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand cause man I dont wanna live no mo
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do
Im livin everyday like a hustle another drug to juggle
another day another struggle
I dont wanna live no mo
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do
Im livin everyday like a hustle another drug to juggle
another day another struggle I had the master plan
Im in the caravan on my way to Maryland
with my man TwoTecs to take over this projects
They call him TwoTecs he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask Whos next
I got my honey on the Amtrak
with the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be Lieutenant bitch got gassed
At last Im literally loungin black
Sittin back countin double digit thousand stacks
Had to reup see whats up with my peeps
Toyota DealaThon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call it couldnt hit me harder
We got infiltrated like Nino at the Carter
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
by some bitch named Alberta over nickelplated burners
And my bitch swear to God she wont snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks Ill make the hooker rich
Conspiracy shell be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G thats me blowing like a bubble
in the everyday struggle I dont wanna live no mo
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do
Im livin everyday like a hustle another drug to juggle
another day another struggle
I dont wanna live no mo
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do
Im livin everyday like a hustle another drug to juggle
another day another struggle Im seeing body after body and our mayor Guiliani
aint tryin to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so shes older now
Educated street knowledge Ima mold er now
Trick a little dough buyin young girls fringes
Dealin with the dope fiend binges seein syringes
in the veins hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breakin days on the set no sweat
Drunk off Moet cant bag yet because its still wet
But when that dry baggin five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashin line
I had the first and the third rehearse thats my word
Thick in the game Ds knew my first name
Should I quit Shit no Even though they had me scared
Yo they got a eight I gotta teck with air holes

Picture a niXga hidin
My life in that man hands while he jus decidin
NiXgas bleed just like us
Id rather go toe to toe with all of yall
Runnin aint in my protocol Since its on I call my niXga Arizona Ron
From Tucson push the black Yukon
Usually had the slow grooves on
Mostly rock the Isley
Stupid as a youngin chose not to move wisely
Sharper with game him and his crooks caught a jooks
Heard it was sweet bout a piece
Ron bought a truck bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked got locked the fuck up
Thats the raw vantage came back speakin spanish
Lavish habits two rings carats
Heres a criminal
NiXga made Americas Most
Killed his babys mothers brother slit his throat
The niXga got bagged with the toast weeded
Took it to trial beat it
Now he feel he undefeated
He mean it
Nothing To Lose tattooed around his gun wounds
Everything the game embedded in his brain
And me I feel the same for this money and diamonds
Specially if my daughter cryin I aint lyin
Yall know the signs NiXgas bleed just like us
Picture me bein scared of a niXga that breathe the same air as me
NiXgas bleed just like us
Picture me bein shook
We can both pull burners make the muthafuckin beef cook
NiXgas bleed just like us
Picture a niXga hidin
My life in that man hands while he jus decidin
NiXgas bleed just like us
Id rather go toe to toe with all of yall
Runnin aint in my protocol We agreed to go and shootin silly
Because niXgas could be hidin in showers with Mac Billys
So I freaked em
The telly manager was Puerto Rican
Gloria from Astoria I went to war with her
Peeps in stole a gun from her workers
And they took drugs they tried to jerk us
We blaze they place long story
Glo seen my face got shook
Thought a niXga was comin for the safe
Now she breakin shut up whats shakin
A Jamaican some bitches I swear
They look gay
In a black Range Rover
Been outside all day
If its trouble let me know Ill be on my way
Please I got kids to feed I done seen you make niXgas bleed
Nightmare this bitch dont leave
Ron get the gasoline
This spot we bout to blow
Lets get the cash before the cops and Range Rover cats know
Its room
Right by the staircase perfect place
When they evacuate they meet they fate
Ron pass the gasoline
The niXga pass me kerosene
Fuck it its flammable
My hunger is unexplainable
Strike the match just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds
And here come two
Opposite sexes
One black one Malaysian
We in the hallway waitin patient
As soon as she hit the door we start blastin
I saw her brains hit the floor
Ron laughin
I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least times in the chest
Spint around shot the chick in the breast
She cryin headshots put her to rest
Pop open the briefcases nothin but Franco faces
The spots hot sprinklers alarm systems
Thats when other guests start to slip in
Its time for us to get to dippin
I know them niXgas in the Range is on they way up
Flippin pistol grippin
I know they clippin
The hallway got real loud and crowded
They walked right past us
I dont know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it
Through all the excitement
They Range got towed they double parked by a hydrant

from the Beretta putting all the holes in your sweater
The money getter motherfuckers dont have better

With your hat to the back talkin bout the gats in your raps

MCs got to feel one caps I got to peel some
To let niXgaz know that if you fuck with BigandHeavy

NiXgaz sayin Biggie off the street its a miracle
Left the drugs alone took the thugs along with me

Began to encounter wit my counterparts
On how to burn the block apart break it down into section
Drugs by the selection
Some use pipes others use injections
Syringe sold seperately Frank the deputy
Quick to grab my Smith Wesson like my dick was missin
To protect my position my corner my layer
While we out here say the hustlas prayer
If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man
Take a better stand
Put money in my moms hand
Get my daughter this college plan so she dont need no man
Stay far from timid
Only make moves when your hearts in it
And live the phrase Skys The Limit
Motherfucker see you chumps on top Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on

Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever NiXgaz in my faction dont like askin questions

The daydreams of how we used to be
See your family
And that babys lookin just like you
Whyd you go away
Ive been missin you lately
Tell me what youre goin through oh yeah I remember sellin three bricks of straight flour
Got my man a beat down to the third power
He didnt care spent the money in a half hour
Got some fishscale rained on competition like a shower
Got the coke cooked up a crackhead Kevin
In eightyeight when Kane ruled with Half Steppin
A thirtyeight a lot of mouth was our only weapon
We was king til the Ds crept in
And now Im missin em Ooh Im missin you
Tell me why the road turns why it turns
Ooh Im missin you
Nah nah nah nah nah oh tell me why why why why We work all week weekends we play the movies
We rock flatops our girls rocked doobies
Made a killin even though the Ds knew me
Eventually you know they try to do me fuck it
Fed up my niXga wanted to take it down South
Sick of cops comin sick of throwin jacks in his mouth
Gave him half my paper told em go that route
Few months he got his brains blown out
Now Im stressed
His babys mother she trippin blamin me
And his older brothers understand the game it be
Kinda topsy turvy you win some you lose some
Damn they lost a brother they mother lost a son
Fuck why my niXga couldnt stay in NY

Cant look his baby girls in the eye
Damn Im missin her Ooh Im missin you
Tell me why the road turns why it turns
Ooh Im missin you
Nah nah nah nah nah oh tell me why why why why There was this girl around the way that made cats drool
Her name Drew played fools out they money in pool
People swore we was fuckin but we was just cool
She used to hang while I slang my joints after school
Shed watch my bomb help my moms with the groceries
My little sister the girl was kinda close to me
A little closer than the average girls supposed to be
Far from a lover my girl was jealous of her
Then she started messin with some major players
Handled keys niXgas called them the Bricklayers
A dread kid had a baby fore that bitch Taya
Found out her babys father cheatin now Drew she gotta slay her
One night across from the corner store
Taya ran around the block with a chrome fourfour
Squeezed all six shots in the passenger door
The dude lived what my baby had to die for
Im missin her Ooh Im missin you
Tell me why the road turns why it turns
Ooh Im missin you
Nah nah nah nah nah oh tell me why why why why Ooh Im missin you
Tell me why the road turns why it turns

Representing BK to the fullest
Gats I pull it bastards ducking when Big be bucking
Chickenheads be clucking in my bathroom fucking
It aint nothing they know Big be handling
With the mac in the Ac door paneling
Damagin MCs oxygen they cant breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q by my side lyrical high
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches
Get smoked like dutches from the master
Hate to blast you but I have to you see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like Kwame and them fucking polka dots
Who rock the spot Biggie
You know how the weed go unbelievable BIG GIE AKA BIG

Dumb rappers need teaching
Lesson A dont fuck with BI thats that

Why yall so dumb now hunt me or be hunted
I got three hundred and fiftyseven ways
To simmer saute Im the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down Biggies hallway
My forte causes Caucasians to say

If I said it I meant it
Bite my tongue for noone
Call me evil or unbelievable Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus Coupes
Leave no witnesses what you think this is
Aint no amateurs here I damage and tear
MCs fear me they too near not to hear me
Clearly Im the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up the way I touched up the grill
Trying to play gorilla when you aint no killer
The gats by your liver your upper lip quiver
Get ready to die tell God I said hi
And throw down some ice for the nicest MC
NiXgas know the steelo unbelievable Im sticking icepicks on the tip of your dick

playing Larry Johnson and his grand mama fuck around and feel the fury of a high niXga
when I get busy throw you hands in the sky niXga
I got the illest of the ill mentality niXgas be grabbing me
knowing that they rather be stabbing me all up in my back
tryna take my track

street rules watch your pockets and your jewels
a niXga front throw a gat to the fool

stuck to your ass like tissue when youre wiping fast
mcs have a hard time believing
Im marked with death hard to kill like steven
with jacob Im leaving
The black mans motto you got a better chance playing lotto Remember back in the days when niXgaz had waves
Gazelle shades and corn braids
Pitchin pennies honies had the high top jellies
Shootin skelly motherfuckers was all friendly
Loungin at the barbeques drinkin brews
With the neighborhood crews hangin on the avenues
Turn your pagers to nineteen ninety three
NiXgaz is gettin smoked g believe me
Talk slick you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niXgaz aint havin that shit
Totin techs for rep smokin blunts in the project
Hallways shootin dice all day
Wait for niXgaz to step up on some fightin shit
We get hype and shit and start lifin shit
So step away with your fist fight ways
Motherfucker this aint back in the days but you dont hear me though No more cocoa leaveio one two three
One two three all of this to me is a mystery
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it
But I stay seein bodies with the motherfuckin chalk around it
And Im down with the shit too
For the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use kungfu
Instead of a mac he tried scrappin
Slugs in his back and thats what the fucks happenin
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat want ta leave a niXga six feet deep
And we comin to the wake
To make sure the cryin and commotion aint a motherfuckin fake
Back in the days our parents used to take care of us
Look at em now they even fuckin scared of us
Callin the city for help because they cant maintain
Damn shit done changed If I wasnt in the rap game
Id probably have a key knee deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either youre slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot
Shit its hard being young from the slums
Eatin five cent gums not knowin where your meals comin from
And now the shits gettin crazier and major
Kids younger than me they got the sky grand pagers
Goin outta town blowin up
Six months later all the dead bodies showin up
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn what happened to the summertime cookouts
Everytime I turn around a niXga gettin took out
Shit my momma got cancer in her breast
Dont ask me why Im motherfuckin stressed things done changed Uhh I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed me with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey
Huh what a set up
Shoulda pushed em dead off wipe the sweat off
Cause in this world Im dead off squeeze lead off
Benz sped off aint no shook hands in Brookland
Army fatigue break up teams the enemies
Look man you want to see me locked up shot up
Moms crotched up over the casket screamin Bastard
Cryin know my friends is lyin
Yall know who killed em filled em with the Lugers from they Rugers
Or they Desert dyin aint the shit but its pleasant
Kinda quiet watch my niXgaz bring the riot
Giving cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie lazy eye

Banger big city boy with deep pockets
See me speak that paper better be the topic
I like my ice frozen like the Antartic
Im quick to finish it your good to start it
And with the flashy colors on you just a target Waitin for a hard hit
I like marine blue marine green roll with a mean team
Meshed out fresh out and stay greams

I aint got shit I spread things take things
Fuck whenever my mood swings from the summer for the winter to the spring

Still tustle still struggle we feel pain
Still ride still die for BIGs name To all my thugs who puffed him
To all my girls who hugged him
You love him yell his name Id rather die on my feet than live on my knees
NiXga please I cock and squeeze for Mafia For BIG I grip the cig put six in your wig

Bitches be scheming I kid you not
Thats why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked
One ho said Big why you so hard on us
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous
Thug niXga until the end tell a friend bitch
Cause when I like you then you go and fuck my friend bitch
And you know that aint right You know that aint right with a friend of mine You see I dont sweat these hoes
I keep them in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
Bitches just like to play the merrygo
It was me Dee the MPV
The blunts and brew thang knocking some Wutang
METHOh shit look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip and recognize a pimp

I seen her on the block who she rapping to
Thats my niXga Dee damn he got G
Now she fucking him and fucking me see
You know that aint right You know that aint right with a friend of mine Uh now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard cause Im a rap star
I be cruising up the block I be passing her
Pimping hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up pissy scheming on a gangbang
She should have used her intuition
Then she wouldnt be classified in that position listen
Shes saying I dissed her cause Im fucking her sister
A message to the fellas that really gets them pissed uh
But she started that fucking family
She fucked my man Dee so why she mad at me True
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
Im glad I aint spend no cash to hit your nasty ass Im sittin in the crib dreamin about Leer jets and coupes
The way Salt shoops and how they sell records like Snoop
Oops Im interrupted by a doorbell who the hell

Then proceed to walkin

And his fist gripped a chrome fourfifth So I dip
NiXga is you creepin or speakin
He tells me CRock just got hit up at the beacon
I opens up the door pitiful Is he in critical
Retaliation for this one wont be minimal
Cause Im a criminal

Honeys wanna chat but all we wanna know is where the party at
And I can bring ma GAT if not I hope i dont get shot
Better throw my vest on ma chest cause nias is a mess
It dont take nothin but frontin for me to start something
buggin and buckin at nias like I was duck huntin
dumbin out just me and my crew
Cause all we wanna do is The rockaway Chorus

Umbilical cords wrapped around my neck

Before I even got my ride
Before I had nickels and dimes

Swear to God to reverse it I give my left eye

Checkin his daughter Tianna into junior high
If I was in Brooklyn and BI Was still alive in it might sound like this
N where Sues rendevouz
Its like Moulin Rouge
High fashion up town Air Force Ones
And Vasquez Puerto Ricans with fat asses
Lace Dutch masters we dump ashes on models and S Classes
For you bastards catch a cab to Manhattan
With that Broadway actin you hype that

Tell the captain ask Rog whats happennin
Out here nor speak no evil inside the Magnum I remember back in time
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines I knew that I was
Goin somewhere let me take you back in time Now Im smokin blunts makin green
Or on the drug scene fuck the football team

Hearin the coach scream make my lifetime dream

Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf naww I couldnt see it
Scarface king of New York I wanna be it
Rap was secondary money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated kinda scary
C mark set me straight not able to move behind a great steel gate
Time to contemplate damn were did I fail
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail I remember back in time
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines I knew that I was

Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass and everybodys looking

This current affairs but who the hell cares
Everybodys fighting over positions musical chairs
On the road to redemption go on and use a few stairs
Im just fucking ready so I come prepared yeah
I know your name yeah
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking bout abortion damn

To Decide
Do we run Should we hide
For the rest of my life of my life X
Dear anne my number one fan
I write with the life of the lamp on my night stand
With a pen in my right hand and thats also my mic hand
Codeine in the sprite can ink on my white pad
Im thinking of life and wrong and right and
Sometimes Im right and sometimes I might
I cannot find the light still my rhymes are bright
So I continue my plan and Im shore like white sand
That there will be price paid before my flight landed
But still I want to see more than my sight can

you to come home everybody got their problems Im dealing with mine I done

Bridge
She loves me she loves me not
VerseLittle Brother
How many ways can I say Im done fishin
You wanted the role smash the audition
Havin a partner for a man in my position eliminates the cooks in the kitchen
Still I got a taste for that fast food foreign cars many women
And some say its the life I was given
I say it dont matter if I work at McEDs
I still got a fix for what you got between ya knees
On a new broad you still one to one
Every once in again I like havin some fun
No disrespect intended but whats done is done
Women steppin out for love men do what to come
Not a playa like Pun but when shorties get the grabbin on me
The last thought I get is Koobie run
To them girls wishin on a star thats will stun
But I gotta tell it like it is hun one
Chorus x Lil Brother First Lil Wayne Second
She say she love me wont leave me wont ever let me go
But if youre thinkin of leaving you need to let me know
We better together then further apart so darlin dont go breakin my heart
VerseLil Brother
We was high school sweethearts talkin since we was teens
Every morning and every evening
Ten years later she eatin that mean cuisine
Im on the field straight gone of that creatine
In the nfl which mean Not For Long
City to city all the groupies they hop along
Word get back to wifey she like Stop the song
Im takin the kids to my mommas Im out Im gone
Momma was like Baby now I hate to see your tears
But Ive been with your daddy for boutyears
And in my day I had to turn a blind eye to cheating
But I aint never had to wear no black eye from beatings
As long as he doing right by you and your kids
How you gon expect that man not to be who he is
I aint sayin that its right but we often pay the price
Cause a womens life is love a mans love is life
And he gon live it to the fullest and I aint tryna pull you down or sound
like a broken record
But you should know by now that all niggas is dogs
Better to have a rich pit then a broke german shepard
Chorus x
She say she love me wont leave me wont ever let me go
But if youre thinkin of leaving you need to let me know
We better together then further apart so darlin dont go breakin my heart
VerseLil Wayne
I say I dont have nothin if I dont have you
Like Shadai we got the sweetest taboo
And my game is skin deep like your first tattoo
I gets all in ya head just like shampoo
I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices
I dont want a broken heart because I lose the pieces
Hey girl dont play with my gangsta
And have the boy blue like a Texas Ranger
And I know cheaters never get crowned
So I play fair like roller coasters and clowns
You gotta hold ya soldier down
Even when the war is lookin it is right around the corner
And you dont want to leave me believe me
Cause I could turn you on like a personal tv
Its young weezy I know what ya thought
But Im just here to play my part so dont go breakin my heart
Chorus x Lil Wayne First Lil Brother Second
She say she love me wont leave me wont ever let me go
But if youre thinkin of leaving you need to let me know
We better together then further apart so darlin dont go breakin my heart
So you made it this far
We upstairs I let you up here
You special Marley dont shoot
You know what this is
Still The Carterpeople
Still The Carterpeople
Yeah you still in the carterpeople
Hey yeah
All I have in this world is a pistol and a promise
A fist full of dollars a list full of problems
Ill address them like PO Boxes
Yeah Im from New Orleans the Creole cockpit
We so out of it zero tolerance
Gangster gumbo Ill serve em a pot of it
Im wealthy still fuckin with that block shit
Wet your ass up head to feet till your sock a drip
Dont slip you might fall and bust your ass
No snakes at the carter tell the gardener to cut the grass
I hear em but they talking under mass
Stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass
Thats Cash Money honey pie
We aint runnin we dont hide screamin fuck the other side
Dont get caught on it this the dailiest grind
Ill put your heart on it and walk on it
The chalks only for the art homie
How they trace ya after I erase ya
Look around we at war and you still in preparation
Im riding for them reparations no patience
Slow paper is better than no paper
Fast money dont last too long you gotta pace it
You gotta know that paper
If you got it from a caper you gotta blow that paper
Gotta know that photofobia no Kodak moments
Feds walls with my pictures on em
Nah I aint even in the school yearbook
I dont do too much posin got a cool killer look
Career crook get your career took
Im back like a brassiere hook
Bitch cheer camouflage gear the hunters here
Better play it by ear you aint nothing but a deer
Around here and this here is The Carter
Serve it while its hot out the pot to your mama
And Slim tell me aint nobody hotter
But get your boys some different sauce I want the whole enchilada
I got em by the collar watch me drop em
On the head at the bottom
You aint gotta shoot em cause I already shot em
And I aint gotta get em cause I already got em
Get em

Tell them niggas no love lost cause I aint got shit to lose

Verse
Its compensation over conversation

Fuck these haters throw your board up if you skate too

But I graduated from that bullshit now I hate school
Outro

My french girls love it when we smoke the oo oui
En belle au france I do when we smoke the ooey

My bodies unique like the sistine chapel
Fresh freshspring apples

And when your really rich then asparagus is yummy

Chainz my first chain had a twin
Gas in my blunt watching ESPN

Salt water pool I can put a shark in it
Everything authentic plus I named my pistols
Last name Fuck first name I Dont Give A
Pockets look pregnant they bout to deliver
So when I start dippin you know the procedure
You leave your home for days and days
All my niggas gangstas all my bitches freaks
I tickle her pussy got that pussy tickle pink

And if that pussy sweet I want that candy trick or treat
I got diamonds in my teeth so all my words are precious

That want another bitch and I dont cuddle bitch

Mo money mo issues I size you up then fit you
Tunechi

Gracias Im crazy yes its obvious

I got my angels on my shoulders and a quarter of that angel dust
I aint sniffin Im just pitchin ya honor I aint snitchin ya honor
Hate bitch niggas bitches with power
Vacate when the kitchen get hotter
I just sit on the counter open the cabinet close the cupboard
Put that jar in the skillet drop a four in the bubbles
I remember being young tryin to hustle my dough
Tryin to tell the old junkies that my crack aint soap
Tryin to tell you fool you chump that my mack aint broke
You aint tryin to see how far that black back lane go
No call me Pacman you ghosts is blue
I got my red river rubies and my oceans blue
Jewelry usually Im a hooligan for the money
Yeah Im eatin but I got a tapeworm in my tummy oh
Make harm in the bomb you in public
Hit you with the straight arm no warning nothin
Look its mornin no yawnin or nothin

You gon make a nigga break a nigga fronts
Then shake a nigga shorts and we takin what we want
Im soyou got to kill me here
If you ever lookin for me bitch I will be here
Cash Money is an army Navy Seal me here
Lot of niggas ran from it but Ill still be here
No chrome on the continental Im so fundamental
Crack the phill crack the roof and roll up the window
And my hood love me they tell me bring it home
Thats why I holla Hollygrove on each and every song
You leapin at a dog a dog wit no bark
Just a bite like an old shark
And all you bitch niggas no paw
Im talkin bout stunna
He like keep ya door he got ya whole winters
Sunshines on the king and sets on the prince
I met the Birdman and I been shinin ever since like that that that that
We here
I said we here
The back of Tha Carter
The back of Tha Carter two oh
Yea this here is the end of Tha Carter Two people
Hey Yea
I got the game on ball and chain
I threw the key in the drain
Im like the key in the drought
I spent a G on these frames though my vision is priceless
Seeing through you niggas like a fucking psychic
Hearing through the grapevine niggas wanna hate mine
Say my name and die in the daytime
You catch my drift man you better be Peyton
Boy the heats on they make a peace bond
Im in this bitch throwing up the seventeenth sign
Straight frowns no daps strapped three times
That Teceleven AK forty seven one Beretta ready for whatever
Tell them pussy niggas come together
Happy better nigga nigga super soaker wetter nigga
Six feet under flowers you aint nothing but a petal nigga
Im just a little nigga trying to be a civil nigga
Thirty years old shit thatll be a giving nigga
Quit it Wayne your Mom is listening
But she aint really trippin cause the pots is pissed in
Them niggas tripping until the shots whistling
Hear them bullets sizzle like a cobra at attention
I gotta bitch and quit calling women bitches
As long as she dont worry bout the coke in the kitchen
No preventing the grind I gotta get it
Im admitted to the game true playa no quitting
There you go shitting on a way a nigga thanking
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin
This is the future aint promised to no one
I live everyday like this is the sure one
Train in the tidal wave this is the ocean
Stand in the heat til the mother fucking snow come
And it feels so fucking good
Throw my dope like a rope let them tug and pull
No hope for the hopeless rats and roaches
Running cross the porch in the attic theres a fortune
Come and get it automatics in motion
We banging for the bread nigga even the molded
I got my loaf I got my toast
Chaperon of the south I got my coast yea
And until I die Im the the the the the best rapper alive
Im mac maine and this young money you betta em
Straight out the hood a young hoodlum
Done what i shouldnt did but they said i couldnt
Hid where all the killas hid at
Im where the other hustlas slung at waitin on that get back
Get that flip that debatin on that mix match
Switch that from dope ta coke
Im goin up fast now you niggas is slowin fast
Now my is niggas blowin abs

Give them niggas something ta them bitches smelling like money after full
court scrimmage
The fam at the table got a full course dinner
Young money cash money throw pifatti at the winner
And yet he understund us when we told him break it off
Cause gangstas talk one word will be a wall
Alone with two cant handle this destructin
All body killin baby sound like seductin

Verse
Age is nothin but some digits nigga trust me on this
Cas I think I speak for every one when I say life is a bitch
I ride D L into the see L Gun right in my grip
I slip a clip in every ripcas hatas likely to trip
Come home to my future wife and every night shell flip
She end up catchin rights to her lips behind diapers and shit
But I like when we split drink henney without ice when Im pissed
Go to the club and start a fight thinkin Im Tyson and shit
But Im a man so Im here to handle my situtions correctly
And i noI might be dumb but niggas gone definantly respect me
But in the mean partner Im fightin gun charges in court
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
Its like im livin happy now
except for the fact my daughter sayin I love you daddy now
And that kinda juice me up and I smoke aboutblunts
and puff a cooler bust me up
And say a prayer for everyday
just so I get through the stuff but I be like
Chorus x
Ahhhh man its complicated doin everythang on your own man
being responsible for everybody and yo own man
and when you feel like everythang is goin wrong man
Im gone stand cause I am a GROWN MAN
Verse
I try to keep my head up but I die to keep my bread up
And usually Im fed up thinkin everythangs a set up
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
And i get hit up with all kinda stress
And put up wit the stuff trust me its tough
But I mantain to climb through it all
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that theres a tomorrow
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awfall
And Im walkin on the edge stuck without a solution
and someway I still pick it out and shuffle to conclusion
And I dont need nobody so keep yo advice and jus dom it
Cas yall cats dont really no me yall jus no bout me
So if my dawgs be on my side they keep me combile with spirit
And plus I know my fathers watchin and my mothers the dearest
And I aint neva said they dont appreciate what I do
But jus know if I wasnt a man I wouldnt make it through
Chorus x
Verse
Who would have known that this was somthin that didnt turn out so hectic
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
Im influenced and effected by the way it became
And I dont play with them at all so I dont say its a game
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully change
Im always street so Ill forever be facin a change
And Ill keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then Im waisten a man
And if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it
Take care of my family first plus the liquor and weed is a habit
And Im so often Im congratulated for the succeced at last
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leadin my path
And I didnt ask for you to like me I dont care if you hate me
But dont mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me
Now you faithfully inspired by the hood tell Im gone
And I dawg I do believe Im grown
so Ill be good on my own but I be like

Girl you are so fine

So I can get my grown man on with you

Gotta attack my mission handle business like a soldier
Young man young money with the money long

We be together
Forever and a day
Well I guess dat day
Came sooner den late
Cus now
Were apart and away
And it feels so stray
Nge wouldnt you say
I use to
Call u bay
And u use to obey
And I just wish we could
Do it again x
Hey
I got my business together
Wish I could get together
But timing is an error
And I
Tell a lie
To you like ever
If I was even ever
Given another chance to
Do it again
Like I died
And gone to heaven
Climbed inside a treasure
Died inside of pleasure like
Wow
Your smile is but of essence
Your child is so precious
I wish
It was paternally mine
But karma is a message
But imma try to test it
And scream for a blessing
So loud
And I hope that you would catch it
And one day you would come fallin
Out of the most highest cloud
Then Ill be there to catch you
Yes
Ill be there to let you
Do da things
We didnt do before
Now
Next time we have to stretch it
Do it never forget it
I never forgot
I wish dat we could
Do it again x
Hey
Im just trynna talk to you
If I could talk to you
Den I would talk
Forever and a day
Yes I remember
So vividly
How we would be
When we lay
And my then blue skies
Were no longer gray
She so brightened up my day
Put it on a scripture
She would be a picture
If perfect had a face
I promise you homie
Dat u would be hungry like me
If you had a taste
I put it on my momma
Cus baby girl is a flower
A flower without a vase
No water needed at all
She continues to grow
More beautiful everyday
And I love her somethin vicious
And Im just wishin
We could
Do it again x

But yet to my Jesus Christ
Nothing but ice

Behind Cristal see night
Snatch your wife
Run up in there with the K why

At first they werent with it
But then I was choking

That Maybach coupe a cockeyed fool
And Im in it like Bennett hoe arent I cool
But if that thermostat switch and that needle move
Then the attitude switch and the heatll move

Meet a disaster pity the fool eat a catastrophe

I tried to talk him but then a nigga had to
Chorus
Real talk boy chill wit the talk boy

And take it off and leave nothing but your T-shirts and your panties on
Feeling high but I'm hung real low looking sorta like a tripod,
So power down your cell phone and power up your iPod
Power down your inhibitions and power up your inner freak
(yea, shit fuck)
It's the only words that you finna speak
Its about to get real x-rated
Can you handle what I'm 'bout to do
But enough about me let me think
Should I be worrying about if I can handle you
Damn right I'm a get that thing and I'm a put my name on it
All night I'm a whip that thing, all state better put a claim on it
I claim my territory, my tongue finna mark you up
You could be my fire cracker, my tongue finna' spark you up
Get ready for blast off, waterfalls gon' splash off
You might lose around 4 or 5 pounds so get ready to sweat your ass off [Chorus]
Welcome to my sex room
Where your body meets my body
Its our private after party
If you want it girl I got it in my sex room
Candles and a pole sets your body to your soul
From the bed down to the floor, sex room
Mirrors in the head board, even got a cam cord
Baby won't you dance in my sex room
Welcome to my sex room
Where your body meets my body
Its a private after party
If you want it girl I got it
In my sex room Let the candles burn, I'm a turn these lights down
And when your body gets hot, it'll get you licked up and iced down
(In my sex room)
Nipples hard as rocks, lips as soft as cotton
Your the apple of my eye, and I got you spoiled rotten
I'm a get my video camera, lets make a movie baby
You the star so as soon as I press record you gots to do me baby
You can stare all in the mirror, take a peek at how good you lookin'
I'm a have your body smokin', take a look at what Luda's cookin'
My arm underneath your leg legs
Or behind your head is how I gots to get ya
Right hand left hand all red in the bed like we've been playing twister
Now I've got you tangled up and you caught all in my web
Should I let you loose nah

You better get a couple towels baby
Cause we about to slip and slide
You don't ever need a horse or saddle
I'm a give you this dick to ride
I'm a grant your every wish and fulfill your fantasy
Ain't nobody else allowed in the sex room
It's only you and me [Chorus] Listenin' to what your body say
We can do it every other kinda way.
Hit it in the sun up in the shade.
Tell me what it is I gotcha babe
Baby lets hop up in the shower,
Baby let me snatch up off that towel, let me get a vowel.

Come into this room, (into my sex) you know what I'm a do.

We heard there's hoes out, so we brought the cars out
Grab the pills cause we popping tonight,
Beat the shit outta security for stoppin' tha fight
I got a fifth of the remy, fuck the Belve and 'cris
I'm sellin' shit up in the club like I work in the bitch
Fuck the dress codes, it's street clothes, we all street niggas
We on the dance floor, throwin' bows, beatin' up niggas
I'm from the D.E.C., tryin' to disrespect D.T.P.
And watch the bottles start flyin' from the V.I.P.
Fuck this rap shit, we clap bitch, two in your body
Grab ya four, start a fight dog, ruin the party
So move bitch, get out the way hoe
All you faggot motherfuckers make way for 2-0
So Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way

Come on player once a ho always
And hos never close they open like hallways
An here's a ho cake for you whole ho crew
An everybody wants some cause hoes gotta eat too [Chorus: x2] Cant turn a ho into a housewife
Hos don't act right

Hey ho how ya doing, where ya been?
Probably doing ho stuff cause there you ho again

Feline, feminine, fantastical, women
Not all, just some

With ugly chicks faces
But hos don't feel so sad and blue
Cause most of us niggas is hos too [Chorus] (Ho)

We go-bots and robots so they gotta wait 'til the show stop

Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man

'Cause you know I got sold out
Or red carpet dick could just roll out
Go 'head and scream you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train when it's hot or when cold out
How 'bout in the library on top of books
But you can't be too loud
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name
Sauna, Jacuzzi in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn (woo) rose pedals on the silk sheets uh
Eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off her feet I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes

But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna get you in the back seat windows up
That's the way you like to fuck, clogged up fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt, rough sex make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown that's the way I like it twerk
Legs jerk, overworked, underpaid but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade, tag team, off the ropes
On the ocean or in the boat, factories or on hundred spokes
What about up in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream help play my game, Dracula man I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reigns, school teacher let me get my brains I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave

But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy (Luda)
How low can you go?(x8) (Squeaky Voice)
How low can you go?(x8) Hahaha Luda! (Luda) [Verse 1]
She can go lower than I ever really thought she could
Face down, ass up
The top of yo booty jigglin' out yo'jeans
Baby pull yo'pants up
I like it when I see you do it
Better than I ever seen it done before
A lot of women drop it to the ground
BUT, how low can you go
Lower than yo' mamas ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would of imagined it
Not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror
Now you doin' it on the dance floor
Mad 'cuz I can't get with you
Just show me how to dance (OOOH)
I may not want to get low
So I'm post it up kinda like a playa do
But if you come to the crib then
I might show you girls a thang or 2
Yeah I think you a superstar
With a ass like that you gotta blew
Before you make it big there's just one thing that I gotta know [Chorus]
(Squeaky Voice)
How low can you go?(x8) (Shawnna)
I could go low, (go low) lower than you know,
Go low,(go low) lower than you know,
Go low,(go low) lower than you know,
Go low,(go low) lower than you know,
Go low,(go low) lower than you know, (Luda) [Verse 2]
I be like knick knack paddy wack
Oh where my kitty cat give a dog a bone
How many licks does it take 'till I get to the center
And let a reala nigga take you home
I can make this show stop
As soon as you hear this flow pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to yo' drop
Put the needle on the record
And I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really gettin low,
Then I'mma shoot a video and put it all on T.V.
'Cuz I like that French vanilla and the caramel
BUT, when it comes to chocolate
I know that very well
Asian persuasion, no discrimination
I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them Puerto Rican pecan
Peanut buttercups like Reese's Pieces
'Cuz I think you a superstar
With a ass like that you gotta blew
Before you make it big well there's just one thing that I gotta know [Chorus] (Luda) [Verse 3]
Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it
Don't stop (get it get it)
Put it in reverse just to back it up
Let me put some Luda in it
Show me what you working with
I'll show you some of this bank roll
Yeah you a superstar
There's just a thing I gotta know
So... [Chorus] Yeah, Welcome to Atlanta, jack and hammer and vogues'
Back to the mackin' and jackin' the clothes, adolescent packin a fo'
A knock on the do', who is it?
I would happen to know, the one with the flow
Who did it?, it was me I suppose
J-D in the Rollz and Luda's in the Cutt Supreme
Skatin down old Nat, Gat tooked and lean
I split ya spleen, as matter' fact I split ya team
No blood on the sneak's, gotta keep it so my kicks is clean
I get the cream, cops see me flick my beams
Im allergic to 'doc perscribed anti-histemines
Oink Oink, Pig Pig, do away with the pork
Only siguar needs a steak knife and a fork
Did you forget your fuckin manners, Im loose with banners
Ludacris, Johnny Rockets when i shoot the cannon
The Wooley mammoth saber-tooth, bitch bite your tounge
I wont stop until Im rich as them white-boy come
I pull up in the black Lotus, you're plaque's are bogus
So I stripped them off the wall
Waiting for my cue to corner pocket eight balls
You rackin' 'em up, Im big paper like pancakes, stackin' 'em up
In fact Im slappin' 'em up, Cadallacin' the truck
I cant loose with 22"s, Bitch thats whats up

Ludacris
Disturbin tha Peace Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia [Chorus: x2]
We on the grind in, Georgia
All the time,it ain't
Nothing on my mind but - Georgia
We ain't playing with you Country name , Country slang,
Fiend at the liquor store,
Lac' cruisin' , crap shooting,
50 on the 10 to 4,
Overcast the forecast,
Shows clouds from plenty dro,
And we ready for war in the state of Georgia
Dirty words , dirty birds
Its mean in this dirty south
Ever disrespect it and we'll clean out your dirty mouth,
Bulldogs clocking,these lookout boys is hawking,
You gotta be brave in the state of - Georgia
I got 5 Georgia homes where I rest my Georgia bones,
Come anywhere on my land and I'll aim at your Georgia dome
If you get in an altercation just hop on your mobile phone,
And tell somebody you need help in the middle of - Georgia,
We some ATL thrashers,
Scope your pumpkin and smash ya,
We'll come through your hood worst than a tsunami disaster,
Don't know who they gonna get or who them robbers gonna hit
That's why I keep my Georgia tech in the state of - Georgia [Chorus: x2] I'm from the home of neckbones , blackeyed peas,
Turnip and collard greens we
The children on the corn dirtier than Bob Marley's pee pee,
G.A the peach state where we stay,
My small city's called Albany - Georgia
Pecan country like catfish with grits,
Candy yams and chitlings,
Grams homemade baked biscuits,
The land of classical caprices and impala super sports,
Ingredients in this peach cobbler called Georgia,
I love the women out in L.A.
And the shopping stores in New York
The beaches in M.I.A
But it ain't nothing like that G.A red clay,
Look on your map we right above Florida,
Next to Bama,
Under the Carolinas and Tennessse you'll see - Georgia,
Where Gladys knights and the midnight train - Georgia,
THE BIRTHPLACE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING
Where ass so plump and hips are thick,
Where Lac' trucks sit on 26's,
Know where you going or you'll get lost,
Found on these plum trees in the south,
These choppas will tomahawk your top down here in - Georgia [Chorus: x2] Now I was born in the belly of the bottom of the map,
Where the wet paint drip jelly on pirelliz an the chrome on The chevy when I'm choppin in the trap,
Country as hell, they some warriors, told sum to spray SumthAn the same shape as Florida,
Lookin' for me boy, ya find me, down in Dougherty County in a Small city called Albany - Georgia
Where they use to call us some mammothz,
An now they jocking the grammar
Watch your mouth unless you out for some mannar,
Bunch of hustlas run on every corner like the waffle house in Atlanta,
Or I be camour flag out in sa'avannah - Georgia
Now you might come for Vacation,
Leave on Probation,
Home of the strip club,
Known for the thick gulz
Where the chicks put tips in the tip cup,
Of thick chick in a thong with a big butt
When it gettin' on, won't be cheap when it on like peach tree,
Make a chick take it off like freaknik, down here in- Georgia
When you see them confederate flags you know what it is,
Your folks pick cotton here that's why we call it the field,
I got a Chevrolet on 26's,
I'm from G.A , G.A - Georgia [Chorus: x2] Georgia , Georgia , Georgia , Georgia - Georgia How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?

From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your block,
Put the needle on a record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini,
And if she really gettin' low then I'm a shoot a video and put it all on T-V,
Cause I like that French vanilla and the caramel,
But when it comes to chocolate,

Asian persuasion,
No discrimination,

Runaway love Now little Lisa is only nine years old
Shes tryin' to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone, and they never met her family
Mama's always gone, and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin' and nobody will listen
Mama on drugs, gettin' high up in the kitchen
Bringin' home men at different hours of the night
Startin' with some laughs, usually endin' in a fight
Sneak into her room while her mama's knocked out
Tryin' to have his way and little Lisa says 'ouch'
She tries to resist, but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom, but her mama don't believe her
Lisa is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back Runaway love

She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty, and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic step dad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions; she makin' up excuses
Bleedin' on the inside, cryin' on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she about
Her name is lil' Stacy, and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight till the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back Runaway love

She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops Ex to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin' sex with a boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep, and she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection; he's usin' no glove
Never thinkin' 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin' for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by, and her belly gets big
The father bails out; he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin' her mama will blow it all outta proportion
Plus she lives poor, so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She say she's about to run away and never come back Runaway love

She makes her own money, pays her own bills, always stat fly, keeps it so real,
But behind closed doors she a nasty girl behind closed doors she a nasty girl.
She got a crazy little figure, nice round ass, walks so proper, talks with such class,
But behind closed doors she a nasty girl, behind closed doors she a nasty girl. I met this girl named Keysha, she was so sweet
Nails stay manicured, pretty little feet
Shoes so sexy, body so hot
Hair lookin' like she just came from the shop
Legs so smooth, clothes so tight
Style so sexy, make her just right
Never too much, never too little
Black laced bra, Vicki secrets in the middle
Eyes so innocent, smile so bright
Works in the mornin, but she'll party all night
All for a man, all 'cause she bought it
All 'cause she crazy in love and don't doubt it
Product of her birth place, know about the streets
Clean in the work place, dirty in the sheets
Keeps her own toaster, makes her own bread
Lady in the streets, but a freak in the bed [Chorus] I got a college girl go to church every Sunday
Had to sneak her outta choir for her to put it on me
But she so innocent, when she when she around her mommy
One thing about her she get her own money
Gave it to her yesterday while she was doin' laundry
Favorite toy of mine is my lil bunny
Bow legged and glasses, such a real woman
Sex all night, go to work every mornin'
Text me from work and told me she was horny
Text her back and told her me too mommy
When you get off work daddy gon' punish
You're my nasty girl forever I promise [Chorus] I got a doctor girlfriend that tells me come home soon
She plays like my house is her emergency room
Tells me to undress and to lay on the sofa
Checks all my vitals like a docs supposed ta
All white coat, all white heels
And nothin' underneath so its an all night deal
I'm a number one patient and delighted to be
And when she needs her medicine I give her Vitamin D
But wait, I got a lawyer girl that's so wild
And every single night she wanna take me to trial
She said she needs some evidence and to show her the proof
So I put her on the stand and I give her the truth
Cause I'm hung like a jury
Judge Luda preside over your body and I'm never in a hurry
You may proceed, let the games begin
And if I call a miss trial we gotta do it again [Chorus] I came to party like tonight will never end
Let's party again
Let's party again
Yea, I came to party like tonight will never end
Let's party again
Let's party again

You about to catch a cold, stay the fuck around from me
Ya peeps talkin' 'bout what kinda shits he on
You disappear like "poof, bitch be gone"
You think twelve gon' catch me, gimmie a break

It seems they wanna finger print me and gimmie some years
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears
I got suede on my roof wood grain on the dash
Sheep skin on the rug, +golden grain+ on the stash
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride

Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I love to park it
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
With the petal to the floor, radar in the grille
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
It's my car's birthday so we blowin' them candles
More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle
Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep
Nos tank in the back, camel hair on the seat
And when I pull up to the club, I get all the affection
'cause the women love the paint and they can see their reflection
I'm about to take off, so f what ya heard
Because my side mirrors flap like a fuckin' bird
And the fools, we gon' clock one and we'll pop one
'cause my folk ridin' shotgun with a shotgun You just got hustled for a wire of cash

Now them gulls up the block still runnin' they mouth
Boy whatcha gon' do? act a fool
If anyone talk bad about the dirty south
Tell me what I'm gon' do? act a fool I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the streets still smoking
See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is tipsy
Off the off ramp doin' about a hundred and fifty
Rollin' through east pernium, on way to ben heel
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin' and we startin shit
I even got a trailer hitch with the barbeque pit
Now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is fire 'cause we stomped you out
And yeah, we blow trees and beez, that's fantastic
So gulls hold ya weave while I'm weaving through traffic
I kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart
You'll be like lil john cue and get a +change of heart+
It's one mission, two clips and some triple beams
I'm about to blow this whole shit up to smithereens The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Tell me whatcha gon' do? act a fool

Stand up! Stand up! If you live for somethin'
You're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter
A toast to life They say what don't kill me can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke to give my lungs a test
'Cause why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death
I'm on a journey yeah I'm on a roll
Sometimes I gotta close my eyes just to open my soul
And tonight is the night I gotta feeling I'm about to act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher 'bout to break some rules That's somewhere to go, but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, for the rest of my life If I got one life to live, I'mma party 'til I'm dead
What the hell is a life worth living if it's not on the edge
Trying to keep my balance, I'm twisted so just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone should say "Women, Weed, and Alcohol" That's somewhere to go, but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey If you live for somethin'
You're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter
A toast to life I'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of time
'Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind
And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice
So I'm willing to bet that I'mma be crazy for the rest of my life For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life Chorus: (2x)
I hate it when it's too many niggas
Not enough hoes
Too many rookies
Not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all yall can suck my dick I got em whip like miracle
Ludacris lyrical fool
We dirty south
Shut yo mouth
We rock jewels
No holds barred
But obey the block rules
Cock tools put chlorine in record pools
Are there anymore like ya
Hell nah
I treat humans like students
Fail yall
So turn your books to page 69 and start sucking
When organize drop the track and start ducking
When Ludacris get in the bed then start fucking
You wanna be starting somethin
Get out the booth and let me tell yall the truth
We kick down doors
Save all the h20 for front rows
Live in the bank and watch what stank hoes
Stay chromed out
And thats on or off road
If you know what I mean
Proceed to stay clean
Light skinned nigga turned red but get green
Inhale some of that dro but blow steam
Love a combination big ass and tight jeans Chorus (2x) Boy you done lost yo mind
Nah I lost my virginity
And I shot quick like that fool that shot Kennedy
Whats the remedy
Henessy coke
If you cut all yo money you still be half broke
Ashes to ashes
Smoke or get smoked
We come by the masses you come and get choked
Take me for a fool I'll take you for a joke
Tired of fast food so they cooked up dope
So now we eating lobster shrimp and thangs
And watch for imposters thats been in the game
We invented the game
And yall just got hipped
Man what that smell
Probably you're upper lip
Cause I love to walk around like my shit don't stank
Even if its cigars in that purple colored dank
Filling in the Gump wit no track of Tom Hanks
Go put this in your jaw like weeners and beef franks Chorus (2x) I put too much sugar in my Kool Aid
And party like a kid wit a high top fade
Arrive to a show and I'd like to get paid
Arrive to a ho and I'd like to get laid
Right up on my back like rugs and floor mats
I'm on the right page but what's my format
I wave to the ocean cause I'm where shores at
And women go nuts just like my bosack
Did you know that
Man I'm the gift of change
Electric stove so give me the keys to the Range
Shagadelic beautiful but strange
Went to Magic City saw Nikki in blew flames
Rearrange
Same braud different night
Pass the E&J; and let a nigga get right
The bomb threaten'd dude that's on your same flight
The highlights that I neva high ass light Chorus (2x) Cadillac grills, Cadillac mill's
Check out the oil my Cadillac spills
Matter of fact, candy paint Cadillacs kill
So check out the hoes my Cadillac fills
Twenty inch, wide, twenty inches high
Hoe don't you like my twenty inch, ride
Twenty inch thighs make twenty inch, eyes
Hoping for American twenty inch, pies
Pretty ass, clothes, pretty ass, toes
Oh how I love these pretty ass, hoes
Pretty ass high class anything, goes
Catch 'em in the club throwing pretty ass 'bows
Long-john drawers, long-john stalls
Any stank puss' make my long john, pause
Women on they cell making long john calls
And if they like to juggle, get long john's, balls All my players in the house that can buy the bar
And the balling ass niggas wit the candy cars
If you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes

All my women in the house if you chasing cash
And you got some big titties wit a matching ass
With ya fly-ass boots or ya open toes

Catfish fried up, Dirty South fed
Sleep in a cot'-picking Dirty South bed
Dirty South girls gimme Dirty South head
Hand me down flip-flops, hand me down socks
Hand me down drug dealers hand me down rocks
Hand me down a 50 pack Swisher Sweets box
And goodfella rich niggas hand me down stocks
Mouth full of platinum, mouth full of gold
Forty glock cal' keep your mouth on hold
Lie through your teeth you could find your mouth, cold
And rip out ya tongue cause of what ya mouth, told
Sweat for the lemonade, sweat for the tea
Sweat from the hot sauce, sweat from the D
And you can sweat from a burn in the third degree
And if you sweat in your sleep then you sweat from me All my players in the house that can buy the bar
And the balling ass niggas wit the candy cars
If you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes
When you get on the flow (nigga throw them 'bows)
All my women in the house if you chasing cash
And you got some big titties wit a matching ass
With ya fly-ass boots or ya open toes
When ya get on the flow (nigga throw them 'bows) Hit by, stars, hit by, cars
Drunk off the liquor getting hit by, bars
Keep yo' girl close cause she's hit by, far
Hit by the Neptunes, hit by guitars
Afro, picks, afro, chicks

Rabbit out the hat pulling afro, tricks
Afro-american afro, thick
Overall country, overall jeans
Overall Georgia, we overall clean

The fancy cars, the women and the caviar,
You know who we are, cause we pimping all over the world [Ludacris]
Sing it hoes,
All over the world baby, it's only right that I share my experiences with y'all,
Cause I've been places where you'll never imagine, but I'ma start at home,
I walk straight up to them and I'm like (ugh), Hey girl how ya doing,
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin,
I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name,
If you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange, Hey!
See I'm the man of this town,
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around,
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinking of me,
We got people to meet and many places to see, Hey!
I'm really digging ya lips,
But be careful where you walking when you swinging them hips,
I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causing a crash
Wit ya traffic jam booty, heads pausing so fast, Hey!
I wouldn't trade you for the world I swear it,
I like ya hair and every style that ya wear it,
And how the colors coordinate wit ya clothes,
From your manicured nails to ya pedicured toes [Chorus] [Ludacris]
You hear the song so dance,
Don't always think I'm trying to get in your pants,
Cause see me my pimpin's in 3-D,
I'm taking you places you only see on T.V.,
Trying to show ya that living is trife,
How many guys you know that can bring the travel channel to life,
One day we on the auto-bind swerving driving,
Next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands,
If you with me ain't no time to sleep,
Especially at wet willies on Miami Beach,
But I drive you off and pay you no attention
If I make it to Atlanta's Brina Brothers convention,
Then jump in the car and just ride for hours,
Making sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard,
Hawaii to D.C. it's plenty women to see,
So if yo ass don't show up it's more women for me, Hey! [Chorus] [Ludacris]
I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican day parade,
Than at night I'm in New Orleans drinking hand Grenades,
Outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest,
In Mardi Gras all the women trying to show more They chest,
Hey I'm in Jamaica spending massive bucks,
While the ladies all begging me to masha tucks,
I had sad Beginnings when I rap wit no fans,
Now it's all happy endings in my lap in Japan, Hey
I used to think that it was way too cold
Til I went to Canada and say some beautiful hoes,
Now I Hit the Caribbean every year in Toronto,
Then fly t Illinois to get a taste of Chicago,
Oh Yet and still you wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil,
Ain't no need of even asking Brah,
The best women are reside in Africa, and that's real [Chorus] [Ludacris]
City Hoes [$Money Mike$]
Pimpin pimpin pimpin,
Ladies and gentlemen as we ride out,
Could we have all the real pimps,

S.g.!
Chris breezy (it's me) [Chorus]
I know what them girls
I know I know what them girls
I know I know what them girls
I know I know what them girls like [Bridge: Sean Garrett]
I know what they feel
Cause I'm breathing on the hills
And it's me they wanna kill
Cause I give her what them girls like [Chorus] [Bridge] [Verse 1: Ludacris]
Relax and take notes,
While I'm put you up on game
Get a sweeter connect, then if I put you up on cane,
But you should grab yourself a seat and a whisky double,
Because the girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble,
They like a little danger and might not admit it,
But they on for the chase and they want us to come and get it,
Plus they love a young thug that's overflowing with swag!
And keeps his women all draped in new louis vuitton bags!
With Louis Vuitton pumps, look at her walk to 'em,
I like open toe straps, but sg talk to em! [Sean Garrett]
I gotta whole bunch of girls I'm tryin' to bring by their kryptonite,
Betta wear your cake, cause they bringing that kryptonite, [Chorus] [Bridge] [Chorus] [Ludacris]
I know what you like baby! [Bridge] [Verse 2: Ludacris]
Yea, we gonna take this to verse 2,
Now some of em wanna family, a sense of security,
Necklace, bracelets and all other types of jewelery,
So, shop till you drop, or till it makes you psychotic,
Here's a triple black card, it ain't tricking if you got it!
Others will stay content if you just making 'em laugh,
Send 'em to the spa, get a massage then bubble bath,
So later on, they can dance and throw a drink in they hand,
And try any and everything they never did with they man, me!
So get loose and slide off your damn garments,
Show 'em whose the boss, they take orders from the sergeant
There's places on your body that I'm trying to find,
So in the sack, talk to me, tell me whats on your mind,
And I got plenty more to learn if you's invested in me,
They don't love me for who I am but who I'm destined to be,
And for that!, I'll give you everything up under the sun,
Cause in the end, all the girls just wanna have fun! [Chorus] [Bridge] [Ludacris]
I know what you feel yes! [Chorus] [Bridge] [Ludacris]
They wanna talk to ya, so shut up and listen!
If you cant take the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen!
Cause a ride or die man for his ride or die chick,
Gets that ride or die pudding for that ride or die shit!
I say,
They wanna talk to ya, so shut up and listen!
So if you cant take the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen!
Cause a ride or die man for his ride or die chick,
Gets that ride or die pudding for that ride or die shit! [Chorus] [Bridge] They wanna go on vacation! I know it!
Lets go! [Chorus] [Bridge] [Ludacris]
Yes! they want what they can! [Ludacris]
Women,
I love y'all, there's not enough time.
Believe that, and if your man don't tell you every day how beautiful you are,
I'm letting ya know right damn now,
You are beautiful baby!
I love women so much, I have one,
Luda!
Chris breezy, this too easy,
Sg what up! [Chorus: x2 Ludacris & DMX]
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (bet a stack)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (bet a stack)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is) [Ludacris]
Let it rush through your veins, cause I'ma be the one
To step up and put a hundred thousand dollars on the game
Got a pocket full of change and they see-note stacks
Busting dominoes, spades, Cee-lo, craps
We shooting pool at the Luda-plex, I slap a hundred on the table
Just to see if any fools want to do it next
I got games galore, I got game for sure
And when I win I spit game to whores (yep)
Or double it back, I'll double the stacks
Throw a dub, a big face or double the stack (boy)
And we can 'bout anything that you want to do
But come up short and oh the things that the gun'll do
Throw in the towel cause I'm making 'em sweat
Or put your house on the line and I can cover the bet
So hurry up and come get some, if you want some
You know the phrase, scared money don't make none! [Chorus] [Ludacris]
Throw some money on the books, cause I know how to call 'em
Somebody tell my fam I got a gambling problem
I don't know when to STOP, maybe when somebody's
Drug away by the COPS, or when I'm blowing steam
Counting green in the DROP, because whether legal or illegal
All my people bring the strength to the block
Yes sir, I thought you knew it, we loco
We'll bet on anything, just to see if anybody's goin' do it
It's people living they life coming up off change
And hustlers paying they bills coming up off games
Whether it's Madden or it's Live, tell 'em pick up the sticks
They call me Mr. Put-Down-Two-And-Pick-Up-Six
Then walk away with a clean slate, catch me out in A.C.
Calling yo' bluff with Puff eating cheesecake
So all my ramblers, runners and money scramblers
Put your drinks up to all compulsive gamblers [Chorus] [Ludacris]
I'm up in Vegas with a stack of black chips
Breaking the whole casino and doing back-flips, man
Cameras eying us, sidebetters trying us
The more chips we stack, the more drinks they buying us
Trying to get me off my grind, but it won't work
Cause I can drink a fifth of gin and it don't hurt
I'm still breaking 'em, and dice still shaking 'em
I'll step in any place, just ask X what I say to 'em [Chorus: x2] It's 2 am in the morning and it...uhhh...light showers

Goodness gracious
Good God almighty

Tongues hang out
Eyes pop out the socket

Cats cringe and point like pssh
Ummph you can see that
Thang from the front
We gas those up like
Full service
And, keep 'em drunk
Like Kathie Lee Curtis
And when you shake it
You rock my world
I done died and
Went to heaven
You got a fatty girl [Chorus:] Okay, I remember the days
High rights, low lefts, even stevens and fades
Troops, Lottos, and BKs, those was the days
Hi-tec boots spray painted witcha names
T-shirts airbrushed that read the same
Thick herringbone chain, one gold with yo' initial
Harris Photos, group shots, can you remember?
Barry him told his bitch go to the prom and die
Didn't lie shot his-self in the head with the 4-5
When she disobeyed, had North Clayton crazed
Just to reiterate dog those was the days
Fo' the invasions of haters, man crews from all around
Used to get down at True Flavas, bumpin Key Lo
Rockin Damage, Cross Colour and Paco
While playboys stepped in talent shows
Prom night, tux and Kangol was so cool
Fuck them new model cars we ridin' old school (old school) We were tryin so hard
Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids In 3 months we stayed in Jamestown
Hamwood and Diplomats
Played with Transformers, G.I. Joe's and Thundercats
We was lovin' that
Before they started jackin' jacks
For notes from Red Oaks had folks scared to come through
College Park after dark, Crown Victorias police unmarked cars
Be aware, Wayne Williams was out there, but we ain't care
Kids was gettin' stabbed and ditched out there too busy playin'
Double dare ya touch shorty on the ass, that's a bet
Want your Kool-Aid and sugar, smack your hands and say "sweat"
It's mine now place it in my Louis Vuitton pouch
Thump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch
Slouch socks, box Chevy Caprice
Hot Niss, cut da whole Disturbin' Tha Peace
Wit no conscience, broke niggas call 'em non cents
No comments, it's Lil' Fate payin' homage to College Park We were tryin' so hard
Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids I had a Long John but no Silver, no gold or plat
I was simply red from the years I been holdin' back
With two sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches
And set fires in garbage pails and cabbage patches
A child of the corn been wild since I was born
Climbin' over barbed wire, clothes got torn
Shoes got muddy and my clique turned cruddy
Wherever I go they went they my buddies
I brush teeth, brush naps and calm streets
Dreamin' of Cadillacs, wood wheels and plush seats
Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats
Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf
When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for action
Starin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one
Wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys
And be with the people makin' all that got damn noise, man We were tryin' so hard
Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids We were tryin' so hard
Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids Yeah, we goin' send this one out
To everybody that put mo' into they cars than they do they relationship
Let's ride Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you [Repeat: x3]
[Luda] It's get out, put my pedal to the flow and let's roll! Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you [Repeat: x3]
[Luda] It's get out, put my pedal to the flow and let's roll! Yes, 7 cars, 8 cribs and ain't a damn thing changed
I'm still pumping 10 kickers, still gripping the grain
Still candy in the paint, still riding them things
And most my folks would say I'm happy but I still feel pain
Until I, jump in my ride, that's my only escape
Me and my automobile's got these neighbors screaming, "Gimme a break!"
It's a pity how we turn our city into obstacle courses
Don't be mad cause I can't hold my 500 horses
Lamborghini's and Porsche's, Ferrari's and Vipers
I'ma wipe the seats with you drool then rub the hood with a diaper
Television on the gas tank, the fuel make the ass stank
I mean to be rude, my bass tubes are in a glass tank
Go strap your seat-belts on, go put your money up
Go put your life on the line, go put your honey up
Go spread the word, run and tell all the boys
Time to play or better yet it's time to bring out them toys
We going Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you [Repeat: x3]
[Luda] It's get out, put my pedal to the flow and let's roll! Assign your name in the streets (sign your name in the streets) Assign your name in the streets (sign your name in the streets) Assign your name in the streets (sign your name in the streets) Assign your name in the streets (sign your name in the streets) Yo, one of my ways of releasing tension while I'm releasing some steam
Even if I just put a fresh coat of wax on I'm making sure the slippers is clean
The 26's is mean, shut down the block, nigga picture the fiends
My system supreme, you can feel the knock, just picture the scene
The chickens just scream, whole crew balling they sick of my team
We getting the cream, I'm through hollering, I'm living my dream
I'm black with a scheme, won't stop until that fat lady sings
And yeah it's actual and factual what my faculty brings
A car show for whatever we slide and wherever we glide
You can keep your rules and regulations man cause we don't abide
And we looking alive, Mercedes Benz, 6 or the 5
In a Beamer, Lexus or Ac', we don't know how to act when we drive
And I fiend for the ride, I lay back and lean to the side
Onlookers and turning heads is all that's seen through his eyes
I'm breezing on by, and no doubt, it's easy to fly
But it's even better when you slow down or ease to the side
And go Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you [Repeat: x3]
[Luda] It's get out, put my pedal to the flow and let's roll! I'm riding up in, GTO's, and fo'-fo'-two's
Grand Prix's, S-S's cause we so so cool
Riding Regal's or the 'llacs, we in Chevelle's and Vert's
Skylarks, motorcycles, ATV's with the works
Malibu's and Camaro's, T-Birds and Novas
Escalade's, Navigators, Expeditions and Rovers
H-2's and Denali's, pickup trucks with the beams
Crown Vics, Monte Carlos, even Cutlass Supreme's
Are going Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you [Repeat: x3]
[Luda] It's get out, put my pedal to the flow and let's roll! Assign your name in the streets (sign your name in the streets) Assign your name in the streets (sign your name in the streets) Assign your name in the streets (sign your name in the streets) Assign your name in the streets (sign your name in the streets) Chorus

Lets go shopping Cause a woman needs options and diamonds and pearls
Then go eat at the finest restaurants around the world
Drink from the finest grapes smoke from the finest leaves
Draped in the finest clothes I wanna put your mind at ease
A full body massage and then let's go catch a movie
Ahh fuck it lets go home and make a movie
Before we can hit the park go find a quiet spot
Then I'll make my body move until your body stops
Cause you know that special spot
It ain't that hard to find
Plus you've been pacing through my mind all the time Chorus
I love it when you cross my mind, my mind, my mind
I think about you all the time, all the time, all the time

Now baby love you eva prep
And full of class when you a step
Soft supple and delicate
Bumper firm and heavy set
Every muckle a mickle make
Giggle, chuckle, every breath
Every freckle spot, every speck, I say, I say
Your performance commands respect
And buckle dance than you expect
Nothing lesser than the best
And I'm a loving intellect
Cause I've thought out every step
Every building must erect
Nothing must be incorrect
Nutten mussin get neglect
Could separation separate
That would be inappropriate
There can be no surrogate
For the loving that I get
My cerebellum will not let
Nor allow me to forget
Eva since the day we met

Headed down to the dungeon, wonderin', if they got some more,
Well, if they don't, then I'ma have to settle fah some dro.
But it just ain't cool 'cause right on afta, I'ma have to go
And continue on my mission, fishin', for the yum yum, but I'm movin' slow. Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire).
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire). (Yes) Fire, fire got me so tired, I'ma stop, drop, and roll,
Put a wet towel under the door.
Don't pass it, I can't take it no more,
Somebody take a trip down to the store.
Hurry please 'cause I need some snacks snacks snacks snacks snacks snacks snacks...
And how long will it take to get back back back back back back?!?
Yes indeed, I'm a lil' off track track track track track track track,
Off this beat and I'm full of dat Yak Yak Yak Yak Yak Yak Yak Yak,
Get on in that stankin' Lincoln, crank it up and ride,
And it ain't enough room to fit the, other chicks inside.
I'm so hungry with the munchies I'ma eat everything, in sight.
Me and my blueberries together and everything's, alright. Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire).
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire). Get the propane, rollin' things and let's blow this place up,
You already know what's up.
I might f had to pay some extra bucks,
But I really don't give a fuck.
Cause a brother feels great great great great great great great great,
But I'm barely awake wake wake wake wake wake wake wake wake,
All bent outta shape shape shape shape shape shape shape,
So stomp on yo' brake brake brake brake brake brake brake,
If you toting good, then all the smokers, let me see ya flame.
Don't know what you got, but my bag'll, put yo' stuff, to shame.
All the different kinds and other flavors, they don't mean a thing,
You can't compare it, don't stare, 'cause I got the ultimate Mary Jane. Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire).
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire). [Chorus]
If men sleep around we some players but for women
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
If men sleep around we some players but for women
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho Now I be riding in my Bentley coupe stuntin' with the top down
Four twenty four inch rims so heavy they hold the block down
Twenty four carrot necklace so heavy it hurt my neck
Three things you can't take away from me, money, power and respect
I got it and hold on to it you knew that I never let it go
You prostitute it but money I never let it ho
Speakin' of hoe's oh yes we meet em and we G' 'em dude
And we may see 'em but we wouldn't want to be 'em dude
I put my fist up, I got the power girl
I wash my nuts off, go take a shower girl
It's been an hour girl, it's time to go
And if my neighbor see you while you walking out my door (hey ho)
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho [Chorus] Can't nobody do it like Kim
Only women that can do it like men
V-V-S is be them gems
(Ho, now count that)
My money coming in
Bringing them corners on them rims
So play the check book tell me how do you bounce that
I bounce into position like I am vinegar Kama Sutra
But money make me come, go and ask Luda'
And women cheat better than men we don't disturb them
My motto is "what they don't know won't hurt them"
We just do it like you do, see the roles done switched
If I'm a ho you's a ho, if I'm a bitch you's a bitch
Know that I'ma stay rich so fella's do what you do
Cause you don't fuck us niggas we fuck you [Chorus] (Hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho) If men sleep around we some players but for women they be saying
(Hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
If men sleep around we some players but for women they be saying She likes the night lights, brights lights, big spending
Lil Fate been big pimpin', pimpin'
So don't be mad at my raps and try and look at me funny
Cause you know that most you ladies trading sex for money
So if you coming out the pocket then you might get laid
That's how the rent car no the cell phone get paid
I bet the snakes all show once you cut that grass
And I'm a pimp so it's time that I exploit they ass
You see it's hoes after the party it's hoes after the show
It's hoes up in the lobby, it's hoes out on the stroll
Here's some no dough, no dough, no sleep
Ho on your feet, if you don't work you don't eat [Chorus] [Intro: Miguel]
I keep dwellin' on the past, babe
Know what I need, yeah [Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Verse 1: Ludacris]
It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence, some befriended me
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
Believe in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking 'bout "that's supposed to be you, girl" [Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Verse 2: Ludacris]
I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
Need solutions, less problems
Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em
Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes [Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Bridge: Miguel]
So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need [Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Young Jeezy:]
On 285, I don't know where I'm goin' on 285, I drink when I drive
I just love when I'm high, I don't know here I'm goin', on 285, on 285, on 285 [x2] [Ludacris:]
I come equipped with 2 straps on my lap move back 45 tucked by my side
Sip a little bit of this, sip that drink up I'm so drunk when I drive.
I'm wood grain, grippin' 'n tippin' on some 24's.
I puff the magic dragon & then blow smoke out of my nose
I try to tell em ain't nothin' change but the mileage on the range
It's baby powder white an I whip it like cocaine
All up an down 285 an I'm goin' around in circles man
My partners call me prince cause they know I got that purple rain
Burners along my waist belt, gotta put up my pants like I'm urkel man
My girlfriend said u sure I said bitch I'm for certain man
I'm hurtin' the game so bad they can't keep up when I count this skrilla
My momma quit her job cause I got her workin' with six figures
Yes she's workin' with six figures 'n niggas is workin' like some slaves
She retired a little bit early because her son is fukin paid
And she ain't gotta do shit but be rich an stay alive
And once in awhile just take her Lexus an drive on 285 [Chorus x 2]
I know it's strange
But my brain's gone really insane
And I'm off the chain
Sipping on a fifth of the Golden Grain
I feel like slappin' a nigga today (slap, slap)
Slappin' a nigga today
I feel like slappin' a nigga today (slap, slap)
Slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today This morning I woke up on the wrong side of the bed (bed)
I'm sick of people putting lies in my head (head)
I don't really wanna work; I'm tired
I hate my nine to five
And I'm thinking 'bout killin' my boss today
Killin' my boss today
I'm thinking 'bout killin' my boss today (it's just a thought, man)
Killin' my boss today (yeah) Yesterday my best friend died (died)
Somebody came and took his life (life)
Now I'm looking up at the sky
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
And I'm asking, why did you take him away?
Why did you take him away?
I'm asking, why did you take him away? (Why'd you take him?)
Why did you take him away? (Hey) I need some money please (please)
I can barely make it on these streets (these streets)
'Cause I got a couple mouths to feed
My baby's in dire need
So I'm thinking 'bout robbin' a bank today
Robbin' a bank today
I'm thinking 'bout robbin' a bank today
Robbin' a bank today (real talk) Baby mama's at home and fussin' (fussin')
Callin' up my mobile, cussin' (cussin')
Always yappin' about this and that
But she really don't be talkin' 'bout nothin'
Somebody take my pain away (Take my pain away)
Take my pain away (please)
Somebody take my pain away (hey)
Take my pain away (I can't take it) [Chorus: x2] Somebody just broke in my ride (ride)
Snatched up everything inside (inside)
Even got my forty-five
How am I supposed to survive
When I know that my stereo's taken away
Stereo's taken away?
When I know that my stereo's taken away (I need my music, man!)
Stereo's taken away (hey) Gas prices are way too high
Rich people are way too fly
And I'm where I wanna be in my life
But why am I so behind?
Is it 'cause I'm wasting my time away
Wasting my time away?
Is it 'cause I'm wasting my time away (too lazy)
Wasting my time away? (I can't help it) My grand mama's nerves are bad (bad)
And everybody in the hood is mad (mad)
'Cause President Bush could give a damn about our ass
So I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say (Don't say nothin')
Shit that he has to say
I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say
Shit that he has to say (woo) Troops gone, and we still at war (war)
Nobody even really knows what for (what for)
Even more I'm scared to find what the world really has in store
'Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today (it's not promised, man)
Tomorrow's not promised today
'Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today
(Live like today could be your last, man!)
Tomorrow's not promised today (hey) [Chorus: x4] Yo hello, Luda

Caldasac trap, Mr. Good Stuff
Ludacris give me 20 push-ups
Last summer, got the hook up
You know what I did
Who'd ever thought up they grew up on one of the BeBe Kids
Type of rat, sat on my ass
And fiendin' for cash
Almost got signed with Puff Puff, but I think I'll pass
Now what we got 'round here is a 20-20 twins
and whats up in my hand, is a bottle of Gin
I love women so I'm in it to win it
In it to green
In it to get in it and get in it again
You got two booties so you whipping yo chin
And I don't blame you
I lay in the sand, y'all lay in the snow and make angels
My ice piece dangle
make my chest look older
Touch it and fall apart like yo High school folder
I'ma Trojan man, BHS hall supplier
Shady park resident and southside Rider [Chorus] Get back, time to get hood jacked
Gold chain, took that
World of Ghetto fabulous Dopeboys and Hoodrats
Be careful what you look at
cause you looking to long
You might go blind in my briefs cause my dick is too long
I'm getting nutt while I'm singin this song
and there is enough for everybody in da party
while y'all hitting th bong
But y'all be hitting my schlong
you play the flute quite nicely
When teeth interrupt, you can watch as I get fiesty
Oh no, you suckers didn't request back up
Broads I seem to rack up
When I pull the gold actor
Get slapped up
Drove up the wall
Put it in Reverse
you can hope for the best, but expect the worst
You at a place like some D's on a Hurst
Its quite funny
Phat Rabbit, playboy bunny
It seems as if that's what I need
Filthy south and D's
That's why I roll in from the Southside breeze
Give it to me now [Chorus] Your pick time to get hood sick
Hit'em wit a good lick
Clean out yo house from the couch to the toothpick
EastSide Ruthless
WestSide leave 'em clueless
My Northside mackers got dis broads acting foolish
And do this for a living
while you stuck up in yo cubicle
Nightlife running dis streets, it sounds beautiful
Women break a cuticle
Ballas break bread
Southside, I represent it till I'm dead
What what [Chorus: x2] Turn the lights off I be representin', representin'
I be representin', representin' Luda, yeah you representin' for bad bitches all around the world
The way you put it down in between the sheets is like no other girl
You done take it a whole another level of freakiness When you blow my mind
To the point where all these other women Kinda feelin' like you stole their shine
So I better come with it,
Ha, and I better come split it
And I admit that I'm feeling a little pressure, when you're telling me I better come get it
Ha but I'm the man for the job
Can't nobody do it quite like I do
And the same go for you, we a match made in heaven, Ima stand right by you

But you can talk me through it

Watch how I put it down You're incredible, edible, unforgettable
Body is so angelical, a rebel with a cause
Speaking in hypotheticals
Could I marry you if I wanted to I'll take you how you coming
Just learn to live with your flaws
Even though it's not that many
You give me that good and plenty And I walk around all day grinin'
My mind and body are gone
That JJ so so sublime
Throw it in the air and turn it to sunshine, you make me wanna call the crib
And say I'm never coming home, Luda! Why you sayin'

Watch how I put it down
I be representin', I be representin' (I'm representin')
I be representin' I be representin' (I'm representin')
Watch how I put it down When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go I done took all I could take from you
Need a little bit more than a break from you
Matter of fact fuck you, don't need you in my life
You done did so much wrong I hope you get it right
But not at my expense, I did all I could do
You just took me for granted, you thought I was a fool
When I did everything in my power to help and please you
But I don't know you no more, fuck it, I caught amnesia
Too many emotions I try to bury
But the higher I climb, the less weight I'm trying to carry
And niggas holdin' on for dear life, bringin' me drama
But I'm only responsible for my daughters Cai and Karma
Nigga you's a grown man, get yourself together
Forget about the past, now's a better time than never
Matter of fact, it's time to start making better decisions
So put your fires out, and stop burning 'Cris' bridges
You little bitches When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go Yeah, this industry's full of bullshitters
And all this time you thought you had me fooled niggas
In my Ferrari, partner thought he saw a spaceship
'Cause I move in speed not to get caught up in this fake shit
Smiling in my face when I'm around y'all
But soon as I leave, niggas be prayin' on my down fall
Is it cause you'll never sell as many records?
My bitches always look better, you fail at business endeavors?
Or that people thought you were clever, but now they know you stupid?
And misery loves company now that you're going through it?
Somebody tell these rappers I worked hard in these Louis
So get out of here, you don't want no parts in this shit, do we?
I see them drugs got y'all trippin' too soon
That's why you find me in the club, every once in a blue moon
So while you contemplate making your first million
I'll be somewhere contemplating on making my first billion
And then, trillion When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go The biggest mistake we make as individuals
Is thinking everyone lives by the same principles
But when I talk by the same teachers or principals
For you to know it's not the money, it's the principle
So I can't expect you to know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Our issues are deep within, we can't just talk 'em out
Niggas is fighting inside, we can't just walk 'em out
These bridges burning so fast, we can't just stomp 'em out
As if you know what I'm talkin' 'bout When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go Did some movies and started missing this rap shit
Back to rap then starting missing them movies
Left these hoes to settle down with just one chick
Get with one chick started missing them groupies
Stop drinking for a year and I was all sober
Next year I got drunk and did it all over
Yesterday I quit smoking and swore I had enough
Till I smelt it in the club and had to take a puff
I got rich and learned life was a bitch
Now everybody's after all of my ends
(Get yo hand out my pocket!)
When I was broke all love from my folks
But nowadays I'm losing all of my friends, let the story begin The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away Start exercising and winning got me a six pack
Was eating healthy and did away with the junk
Then I got lazy and started to wanna kick back
My six pack reverted back to a gut
When I'm at the crib I'm mad I'm not at the club lit
When I'm at the club I'm mad I'm not at the crib
I used to be out partying every damn night
Now sometimes I'd rather be with my kids
I got checks gained a lot of respect now everywhere I go they holla my name (Luda!)
But sometimes wish that I was disguised for peace of mind over fortune and fame
Guess what I'm really saying The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away Last year got the Ferrari that I always wanted
Drove it crazy got sick of it had to trade (Give me my Ac'!)
All my fans convinced me to grow my hair back
Grew it back then started missing my fade
I got hits start trippin' I wasn't underground
Got underground start trippin' I need hits (We outta here!)
When you down and people give you the runaround
But feels great to know who really gives a shit
You cut the grass and the snakes will show
And know your neighbor's fertilizer is fake (Don't let it fool ya!)
We always searching what we never had
Always ignoring what's in front of our face
We've been conditioned to think The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away [Gucci mane]
Hey how you doin, Ms. Lady? You so fine with it
I know you handlin business, can I get your 5 minutes?

Wit all that shake, can a player get some fries with it?
s Gucci [Ludacris - Verse 1]
That waist got a swivel to it
But that ass a Cali earthquake jiggle to it
She a stallion, no horseshit
You could fit that bitchs booty on a forklift
Beep! Beep! Bitch back it up
I put my balls on the table, tell her rack em up
Vanilla bed sheets, chocolate laid one way
Sprinkle my nuts on top what a sundae, hey
Whipped cream cherry on top
And when I aint wit her, p-ssy on lock
Throw away the key, its a rap bitch!
Large shake and a Ludacris sandwich [Hook] [Gucci Mane]
Yo, mama turned out, she so popular
You suckers cant see her with binoculars
Shell suck your pocket dry like Dracula
Her last boyfriend bought her an Acura
Dont try to get all attached to her
She an alley-cat type that chickll scratch you up
Like Bel Biv DeVoe said, Shes dangerous
Her old man used to snort angel dust
So, dont be quick to judge, shorty bad as f-ck
Shes the type that drive back with the bricks for bucks
She had a ballplayer dude but she f-cked him up
He bankrupt, selling cars like an auctioner
Its Gucci [Hook] [Ludacris]
Ive got a sausage for them hot cakes
And I be f-ckin while you niggas out on hot dates
You all polite and open doors for her
While every night I put that blanket on the floor for her
These hoes be sprintin like its track n field
Because this supersize dick is their Happy Meal
So for an extra value woody
Put this Big Mac into that Quarter-Pound p-ssy, yes!
Its Ludacris Mr. Slay-A-Bitch
Unless that p-ssy is smelling like a Filet-O-Fish
Shoo Fly, ho! Kick the bucket
And niggas talking shit I bust em in their chicken nugget [Hook] When the liquor get up in me
When the liquor get up in me
When the liquor get up in me
When the liquor get up in me I'm a motherfuckin' beast (When the liquor get up in me)
Tell these niggas clear the streets (When the liquor get up in me)
I'll be all up in my zone (When the liquor get up in me)

These haters want my paper and the snakes is out to get me
So when I leave this bitch I'm taking everything with me
With my wrist glowing and my fist throwing
And my Lamborghini Aventador sneak it on the block
Been going and I been flowing I gotta say that Ludacris, a nigga never gonna stop
Hanging with women that's loving them drugs
Neighborhood call me the plug of the plug
Poppin' a pill and then jump in the tub
We buy out the bar, we buy out the club
Got a black, AMX, I left home, no Visa
Talk money, and my money, talk back, like Caesar
Mix soda, with the syrup, we be leaning like the Tower of Pisa
And if y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all either I'm a motherfuckin' beast (When the liquor get up in me)
Tell these niggas clear the streets (When the liquor get up in me)
I'll be all up in my zone (When the liquor get up in me)

Ah shit I'm talking 1 shot, 2 shots, 3 shots, 4
How many shots to hit the motherfucking floor
You sipping man, quit tripping man, stop acting like a ho
Waitress said another round? I said you already know You see I started from nothing and made it up outta the hood
Dollar and a dream and I made what I could
Fifty to a hundred, then a hundred to a grand
Then a grand to a milli, nigga really what's good
It's wood in the whip the wood like a wood shop
Neighbor's all think that I cook rocks
No peace in the streets
Really got me thinking ain't no such thing as a good cop
My neck froze and no ice steel
Flows, rappers just bite still
Platinum plaques, three Grammy's
I tell you I Made It like Mike Will
With coupes all on that freeway
Pockets on Gabby Sidibe
Got cake and women blowing like everyday is my b-day We be getting mighty bold (When the liquor get up in her)
She be sliding down that pole (When the liquor get up in her)
She be shaking it for daddy (When the liquor get up in her)
Getting freaky in the Caddy (When the liquor get up in her) Get lit (Get lit)

A titan like Tennessee but she chiefing like Kansas City
She love it when she get tipsy and strip to the core essentials
With her legs sprawled out like the Air Jordan symbol
She be twenty thousand feet in my apartment in the sky
Y'all hoes just drink and drive, my woman just drink and fly
She a lady in the street ain't nothing fake about her booty
She call me for special ops, I told her that's my Call of Duty She be getting mighty bold (When the liquor get up in her)
She be sliding down that pole (When the liquor get up in her)
She be shaking it for daddy (When the liquor get up in her)

Hold the line I got ya momma on 3-way,
Tell her Ludas got more records than the DJ,
Tell her she should blow me like candles on ya B-Day,
Cause I've signed more lines then she's passed on the freeway,
More checks then you ever could imagine more wood up in my whip then in a forest full of cabins,
And yes I stay high on that purple like Aladdin,
And Women say I talk more game than John Madden,
How'd it happen how the let me in the booth,
How they let these rappers lie how dare I tell the truth!
I'm the truth and these other boys phony, it's a movie so act like ya know me. I'm A lyricist to the death so I got what ya need, Ludacris,

Spittin' at ya head full of bread like toaster,
Never had a holster, I keep it on my lap,
And Hip Hop aint dead it just had a heart attack,
What you see I keep it pumpin yeah I got that hard back,
So just call me Little Carter or Little Cardiac,
Precious like a artifact, Valuable like a quarterback,
Hannible like they call me jack, Fall back like a starter hat,
Nah did he thought of that,
I mean how did he think of that,
I mean how did I think of that, Now like a rental bring it back,
I mean how did I think of that, I surprise myself sometimes,
Someone should throw me a surprise party for every line,
Every time I do what I do I do it dirty like swine for the dirty and fine hip hop I'm alive! I'm a lyricist to the death and I got what ya need, Weezy F,
The last ofa dying breed, and we almost extinct so I'm saying it loud,
Say it with me (Mcs move the crowd) [Repeat x3] [Ludacris]
This is music muscle mania, my verses on steroids,
Private planes I'm on the jet son like Elroy,
Flying through the sky at amazing speed,
We on that superman kush or that amazing weed,
The new Bentley came out my team said LUDA GET IT,
Twenty thou says that I'm the only nigga WIT IT,
New Era on ya brain like a A-Town Fitted,
And I'm not E-40 but I'm so sick wit it,

Hoes I gotta view, but I'm stingy with the dough I'm like no not for you,
What the fuck was you thinking?
Off what I'm banking, Me and Wayne on that lean what the fuck was you drankin?
Stinkin' like a dead body up in the woods,
So I stashed it like a weave coming up in the hood,
And if you down for no bad then we up to no good,
And it's important that you make it understood I'm a lyricist to the death so I got what ya need, Ludacris,
The last of a dying breed, and we almost extinct so I'm saying it loud,
Say it with me (MCs move the crowd) [Repeat x3] Cry me a river, cry me, cry me, oh

And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the fifty yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for tree
And if you like in the club we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P.
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots so they gotta wait 'til the show stop
Or how 'bout on the beach with black sand
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man ain't Ludacris (woo) in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it lover lover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I past 'em get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and out last 'em
And if ain't good then I trash 'em while you stash 'em
I'll let 'em free
And the tell me what's they fantasy

Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave

Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna get you in the bath tub
With the candles lit you give it up till they go out
Or we can do it on stage of the Ludacris concert
'Cause you know I got sold out
Or red carpet dick could just roll out
Go 'head and scream you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train when it's hot or when cold out
How 'bout in the library on top of books
But you can't be too loud
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name
Sauna, Jacuzzi in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn (woo) rose pedals on the silk sheets uh
Eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off her feet I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna get you in the back seat windows up
That's the way you like to fuck, clogged up fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt, rough sex make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown that's the way I like it twerk
Legs jerk, overworked, underpaid but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade, tag team, off the ropes
On the ocean or in the boat, factories or on hundred spokes
What about up in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream help play my game, Dracula man I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reigns, school teacher let me get my brains I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes

Wonderin' how I can get me some
My family's strugglin', I'm buggin', sittin' on my porch
So confused, chewin' on some bubblegum
I was always taught to use my manners with the misses
But please, stay away from the hoes and snithes
And I was always reached for the sky, I don't know why
I'ma little bitty kid wit' a whole bunch of gangsta wishes
When I grow up, you just wait, I'ma be so straight
And everything's gonna be so marvelous
No more borrowin' from the neighbors, no more haters
No more blowin' Nintendo cartridges
I'ma have it made in the shade, I'ma be so paid
And my fam, get 'em off that payin' them bills
Matter fact I'm schemin' my way on up out this hood, I'll be good
When I ditch these trainin' wheels I want to (Diamond in the back)

Been patient waitin' on my set of wheels
I'm willin' to do what it takes, whatever the stakes
In order to get myself some dollar bills
It's too many holes in my socks, and I'm ready to box
Anyone tellin' me I need better shoes
And I ain't the only one trippin', or makin a fuss
My older cousin need some cheddar too
He thinkin' 'bout comin' up on the lick, to get it quick
It involves that local corner store
I overheard him say he knew who works there
And whatever they do, don't let the owner know
I hope he come back with enough to let me borrow some change
At least for the summer
And if he don't let me borrow nothing, but ask me what I want
I'ma tell him I wanna I want to (Diamond in the back)

For goodness sakes, I'm just a kid
Had to get my whoopin' in fo's, I was just a po'
Like there no remorse for what I did
Gotta learn the hard way, when runnin' them streets
How some just creep, really just to eat a meal
"I could of swore it was mine," what I used to tell the po-pos
What I left to rob and steal
Man, I gotta earn for a livin', ain't nobody givin' me nothin'
Find somethin' I love to do
Hmm, what about that pimpin'? It's good tippin'
Tax free, and I know a lot of people that love to screw
Yeah, it's just a way of the world, with boys and girls
I'm adjustin' to my environment
This government cheatin' us, so I'll cheat 'em back
Why can't work feel like retirement? I want to (Diamond in the back)

Your inner thigh, right on your knee cap or your belly button.
These other guys be out here talkin' but they steady frontin',
They don't know what they want that's why I tell you put your trust in me.
Share all your secrets, all your desires and your fantasies.
I ain't gon' tell nobody, baby I'm an only child.
I'd keep it to myself cause all I wanna do is see you smile,
Knowin' that you got someone to talk to ain't that what you want?
I'll be your lover, your provider, and your confidant.
And I won't judge you cause I know that ain't nobody perfect,
But you got some perfect imperfections that makes you worth it.
I wanna see yo body in all the positions that you like it in,
We could do it slow or have some drinks, it gets in enticing when,
You like it rough I give it rough and I start to pull your hair,
Cause ecstasy's your destination and I'ma take you there,
Tell me a secret baby Tell me somethin' that nobody else knows,
And think about it just as soon as the door close.
Tell me a secret baby,

Show me somethin' that nobody else sees.
Tell me all the things you would do if it was you and me,
Tell me a secret baby.
Tell tell tell me a secret baby And there ain't nobody in the universe that competes with you,
Imagine all the possibilities and the freaky things that we could do.
Blind folded,
Handcuffed to the head board never let you go until you scream my name,
Maybe you think I'm playin' but this is really far from a mothafuckin' game.
Ain't a damn thang changed still nasty as I wanna be.
And I got just what you want baby girl you want it,
See it'll turn you on and it's gonna be on as soon as I take it off.
Just give me your body its guaranteed that I'ma
Break you off, off, off, off, off until the sun rise,
And I'm not here to disappoint just give me one try.
One kiss one pinch and you could take it or leave it,
But before you make up your mind just tell me one secret,

Tell, tell, tell me a secret baby Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Tell me a secret
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa Wake uuuuuuuup
I see the sun shine gazing threw window pain
Blazing like indo flame its time to wake up
Co0me to ur senses manye
Snow is all around you
But you dont play no winter games
Cartrage all around you
But you dont play netendo games
Load them up and fill them up to the top
Before you cocking them
Trying to get from the botton to the top
Like the stock exchange
See I was shitting shaving
Hit the coner for a block exchange
Amazing what my people would do
For some pocket change
But maybe this aint the life you choose
This is the life you stay strapped and pack a knife
Or end up with a bloody nose
Street survival or survival of the street
And only the strong survive
There's no survival for the weak
Catch a sneak eak at death if ur not on ur p's & q's
They carry banana clip and niggas will peel u for ur shoes
This is the blues but not all hill street
U can call it kill or be killed street
Lost a pint of blood let it spill street
Stop and wake uuuuuuuuuup
Wake uuuuuuuuuup They say my folkes would do any thing for the fortune and fame
And it will take a fortune to get rid of all the pain
But im saying use ur brain homie do the right thing (let me talk to ya)
Use ur brain homie do the right thing (let me talk to ya)
You say the only family u got is in the game
And the only way to make is by sell cocain
But im say use ur brain homie do the right thing (let me talk to ya)
Use ur brain homie do the right thing (let me talk to ya) Hi, my name's Ludacris, and I'm high as giraffe pussy
And I'm close to the edge, so yo' parents can come push me
I curse so much just to get on they nerves
I got kids "Actin' a Fool" from the traps to the burbs My filthy mouth, it won't fight cavities or beat plaque
So I shot the tooth fairy and took my old teeth back
I'll take a shit on the equator, the size of a crater
And make government officials breathe harder than Darth Vader It's the chicken and the beer that makes Luda keep rappin'
But no pork on my fork, I don't even speak pig Latin
I go fishin' on my lake, with yo' bitch as the bait
Plus I eat many MC's, but I don't gain no weight The number one chief rocka, clean out yo' rap lockers
I'm as stiff as a board, y'all more shook than maracas
But my trick ain't for kids, if you dig 'em, you'll get smacked
I'll clock ya, I'll spring forward, you fall back Every album that I drop has got more than ten bangers
That's cause I'm a shot caller, y'all fools is Crank Yankers
Ain't a damn thing changed but the ice on my chain
To get chicks from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine Now I roll up torpedoes, get blunted with Rastas
For a hefty fee, I'm on your record like Bob Costas
I own so many jerseys I'm a throwback mess
I hit the cleaners and tell 'em I want a full court press So momma toast your glass while I'm countin' my cash
'Cause every single is a smash, I'm hot as a camel's ass
The competition never just want to admit that they lost
And that they last about as long as my part in the wash From yo' car to a crap game, no one rolls wit' you
One of Mini-Me's shoes got more sole than you
So by the time you figure out why your record ain't spinnin'
I'm in the strip club smokin', with President Clinton So stand clear of the long sideburns and goatee
They may the mold of the penis enlarger off me
I'll be in another room when I hit from the back
Not to mention my refrigerator's taller than Shaq So yippie-kay-yay, yippie-yie-yie-yo
If you can't swim, don't smoke my hydro
I've been lookin' for a woman just to put my stamp on
But a lot of y'all are mo' stuck up than tampons So wash all ya sins away and stop playin'
If God's line is busy you might have to two-way him
Then catch me in your backyard, playin' croquet
And when I'm drunk tell them kids, "Drugs are bad, mmm'kay?" Or watch me swing my chain at the Roscoe's off Pico
Got seven cars, get all my rims at Chrome Depot
And people think I'm bad, they say "Oooh he's so evil!"
'Cause I go on blind dates, with actual blind people But my album's out the store, yours be on the shelf
I heard you masturbate a lot, so y'all keep to yourself
'Cause these women want a man that stay up and stay strong
Like the NBA, you gotta play hard or go home All that shit that y'all talkin', y'all can pop it to them
'Cause Ludacris will beat you down with a prosthetic limb
I put my foot so deep in yo' ass that you can smell it
And yo' breath will turn to Foot Locker water repellent I'm the man, I got money far as the eyes can see
And I'm in a group, I split dough with me, me and me
So much money in my jewelry that I'm damn near sorry
So I'm a trade my earrings in, and get a Ferrari I buy cars with straight cash, have meetings with Donald Trump
y'all meet with Honda, no payments for 12 months
Take a look at yo' life and no wonder you so sad
Y'all put up with more shit than a colostomy bag, fool! So I'm just sitting in this rehab class
Trying to get myself unhooked on ass
So then my teacher asked me a question
Like Ludacris are you over there sexting
Ha ha O-M-G l-o-l K-I-T Smiley faces X and O's L-M-F-A-O

My girl went through my cell phone So I pull up to the club stunting in a yellow Lamborghini
Half bent, black tint, fine pussy make it a little hard to see me
Stepped out, fresh out headed straight for the door and to the VIP
Next thing I got a text from a freaky Latina saying is that you I see
Is that you papi
So I B-B-M'ed abbreviate yep and before the night gets too late
Let me hit you with a little Q and A
Can I tap that ass t-t-a
She replied it all depends

Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? I'm still back for the first damn time
So grab a hold of your seats while I open your mind
And take you back to when I dropped down from heaven
And I came out my moms and had a mic as my fucking weapon
When I was three I was just a little G
But if you looked in my eyes you'd see the future of a real MC
And at the age of nine I wrote my first rhyme
Soon rapping became one of my favorite pastimes
Every where that I went spitting and babbling
Showing my ass, growing up then started traveling
From one city to the next, Luda landed in the ATL
Where the pimps and the players dwell
I made a tape, did shows and got exposure
And kept learning as my black ass got older
No matter what I just kept at my trade
I made mistakes but stayed sharper then a Ginsu blade It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? Age fourteen, my talent show a beast outta cage
I would of won but disqualified for jumping off stage
But I ain't care, cause this game has started to open it's arms
When I was at Banneker High School pulling fire alarms
So I could get a crowd around me, make a name for my block
People told me "keep flowing," they ain't want me to stop
Was back when Big Nose John was my human beat box
We'd skip school, hit open campus and watch out for street cops
Now I'm known around the town as that nigga that raps
From the hills that made high to them G roll traps
And I was still making demo's, perfecting the craft
And some said I wouldn't make it, they would giggle and laugh
So I picked up a couple books by Donald Goins
Bout the business of this shit, how to flip a few coins
Before the age of eighteen, I was destined to make it
My bank account read Disturbing The Peace, incorporated It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? Age eighteen, I'm strugglin', just to survive
But got a gig workin' for change at 97.5
Now I'm rapping on the radio, increasing their numbers
Still Ludacris but alias was Cris Luva Luva
Late nights I'm in they studio and using they tools
Me and Puma smoking weed and breaking all of their rules
And I was krunk, all the big wigs was hearing my songs
But nobody did shit and they was taking too long
So three years went past, and I saved enough cash
To make my own record label and put myself on blast
The album was independent, it was just for the streets
I sold a one thousand copies in my first fuckin' week
Then went on to sell fifty, put the cash in my hand
All the record companies bite me, but I chose Def Jam
And the main reason that I made it and I love the A-town
Was 'cause the block had its eye brows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? Yea-uh, here we go here we go here we go
Talk about that Word of Mouf baby
Yeuh, yeuh yeuh yeuh yeuh! Here we go, here we go
Ludacris, 4-Ize, D.E. what you want now now now now Check it
You see I live a life filled with chicken and malt liquor
And women that are real life scratch'n'sniff stickers
I shoot videos and get knobs slobbed in trailers
Then hit stage and break a leg like Lawrence Taylor
You pricks is all talk, and it's bad for your health
See I ain't gotta say shit, money speaks for itself
With all models I make I'm great like five lakes
You got rims on ya truck? Man I got rims in my skates
You rolling on dubs, I roll right into clubs
Dirty as home with more rings than ya tub
You think it's all practical jokes and big bloopers
But I smack bitches with no titties that work at Hooters
Just get a couple of girls that shaking they thangs
Then I put 'em on camera and cut two frames
With some gasoline drawers I'll be going to Hell
Ludacris, fuck like a nigga fresh out of jail
I got Junkyard Dogs, I'm rowdier than Rod Piper
And my baby's assed out, 'cause I rub my cars with her diapers
So you can pray for now if you sinned in the past
"Word of Mouf" time to wipe that silly grin off yo' ass These rap cats is soft like R&B; singers
It's 4-Ize, I've worked for wings and chicken fingers
I reps mo' parts so Chi-Town could get seen
I'm a Dirty Bird now but I keep shit clean
I rip meanface niggas one by one
Or two by two, I'll take 'em however they come
Instead of a gun, I'll pull out a stick from woodworking
The black Hacksaw Jim Duggin stay lurking
Creepin, I'm in the shadows, the nightshade
You want the tail in the back or, a light fade?
Cause Tony Scissorhands is the barber, the butcher
I kill ya smoke a blunt and forget where I put ya
I'm Soopafly like Snuka, I smack hoes
The black rolls with the dozen attack flows
I rock Shaq's clothes when I Alter Beast
Power up, get big, it's Disturbin' Tha Peace I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass, (it's Saturday)

Should I wild out, what the fuck?
Act like my rims ain't clean
How you gonna act like my neck don't bling?
Haters get sprayed like afro-sheen
But they don't never really wanna pop them things
Cane, cane sugar man Luda don't go
And I stop at a light, pull off so slow
But I'm out for the night, so pass that dro
So, daddy come home in a Cadillac brome, Cadillac brome
Now don't it sound absurd

Keep a couple rolled and I hit the club in the back door, nigga what?
Act like I don't make cloud, how you gonna act like I don't get loud?
How you gonna act like I don't rock crowds?
And leave a lot of people with a gap tooth smile
If I recollect right then you sound like dirt
But, I guess what you don't really know don't hurt
With a vest, and a pump hear the shotgun squirt
My folks on the block, man, they got that work (they got that work)
Don't it smell so good, in Southwest where they rep that hood
Protect your chest, they up to no good
And come through flossing, they wish y'all would I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash

Act like I just do rap
How you gonna act like I just ain't strapped?
How you gonna act like I don't push lacs?
Black Eldorado, fifth wheel on back!
Ichy finger trigger, man, Luda don't squeeze
With a mac, with a glock I'ma make 'em say please
In the back, on the block so the cops they freeze
And I'm so high, I think I got a nose bleed, you gotta nose bleed?
Don't it smell so sweet?
In Decatur, where they pack that heat
And rob neighbors in the night creep, creep

And feel this dick-dick getting out of control-trol
Oh no keep going till a nigga like me say stop

Tuck and twist if you don't like it, you're fuckin' Cris

But your heart'll melt if I put a thousand in your garder belt

Smokin' purple, potent, green shit got everybody geeked
In the club 7 days a week, find DTP up in this beesh
That ho popping, dropping, Goddamn shawty who is this?
Redbone wit a Scorpio tatted on her tummy
I'm sitting slouched back in the chair, stunting, waving money
And shawty star, zig zagging her derriere for me
A bowlegged thoroughbred and said her name was "Strawberry"
Up her pussy, shawty pushed in a whole bottle of Moe'
Reached in my pocket grabbed a G and then threw it on the flo'
"Here, you deserve this doe. Now jump on stage and work a pole"
Face down, ass up hoe, hands on poles
Now pop that coochie, you know the procedure
If you want this cash, gotta make that ass shake like a seizure
Either magic or please us

Maxing out my visa
Tricking on strip teasers Head down, pussy pussy popping

Go to sleep, hoe to sleep, go to sleep, hoe to sleep
If you're tired be quiet and go to sleep, hoe to sleep Man, I tell a hoe to go to sleep (go to sleep)
They turn around and frown, gotta make 'em six feet deep
'cause we knock 'em unconscious with that non-sense
Read in between that fine print, think about lyrical con-tent
Then about where your time spent
Mess around get your guys hit, a ten hut!
I send three-six ol' shit, nigga what?
If ya tired ya tired, if ya snooze ya lose
But'chu you won't wrap up ya bandages, or hell you would Nigga I got shotty's and semi's, I love 'dro and henne' ?
All brown and skinny, but I've fucked up so many
I got qp's and halves, if we beefin' I blast
You sleepin' I laugh, ask 'cris, I'm off the rip
I had this hoe who talked too much, I had to off the bitch
2-0, Mr. Crayola, niggas know what I mean
'cause I slang brown, white, yellow, purple and green
And all you fagot-muthafuckas gotta know the routine [Chorus: x4] Bitch it's me again, kickin' in your fuckin' doors
I look for div-idends, I ain't lookin' for you hoes
You bitch can't com-prehend, let me put one in your boot
Let me put one in your boat, so you ? can go to sleep
So, lay down bitch, gimme all that you dreamed for
Gimme fancy cars, gimme bling-bling-bling, boi
It don't mean a thing, boi, for me that ain't gon' swing, boi
Them god damn toys, do you know what I mean, boi? Now if you warrin' and runnin' from them three-six niggas
This forty-five gon' give a reason to sleep, nigga
Or bustin' massive 'round some s.k.
My last trip to a-t-l I fucked yo' cascade
I'm strippin' bitches and I'm a ball fucker with a limp
They call me infer-stripper, sexy, red hoe's pimp
And quick to sink her on the nigga 'cause this what it's 'bout
We rob that trick and stick his dick off in his fuckin' mouth
We memphis niggas [Chorus: x4] North, north, south, south, westwood, orange mouth
Nigga we be smokin' life, never shut ya charlie brown
Memphis niggas in this bitch, pockets full, ya know we bail
Hooked up with my nigga 'cris, then we head to a-t-l
Playas wild, throwin' bows, tellin' chickens, "fuck you hoe!"
Nigga rollin' up the moe, as long that white shit up they nose
Mayn this town is like my town, so we stayed and hung around
Juicy j be high as fuck, catch me in the lost and found Better use common sense checkin' me out for bitch I can stand for
And up, get yaself in this clique
Without my tongue licks, behind me gettin' handcuffed by a slut
Look, I'm from gittero what?
Southside niggas throw it up when it's time to get buck
Niggas in the back of the club postin' up
Waitin' for a nigga that's new to make it up
Ass in, ain't no askin', it's no tolerance as long bitch check in
She wit' me, comments will only get'chu basically eternally resting
So abide by the call of the streets
If ya got a bitch better keep her on a leash
? gonna creep in ya home while you gone
Have you comin' back findin' nutt on yo' sheets [Chorus: x4] I'm never goin' nowhere so don't try me
My music sticks in fans veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin' to sign me
Respected highly, Hi MR. O'Reilly
Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin' to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (blaow!)
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so mean in my white tee
Nobody light-skinded reppin' harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me! Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Alright)
Rappers swearin' they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)
But I'm comin' for they number one spot! (Alright man)
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say what?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steerin' column on yo' Impala
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell 'em holla
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha
Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
I'm double-X-L so I call 'em my "Eye Candy"
Brush my shoulder and I, pop my collar
Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Alright)
Rappers swearin' they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)
But I'm comin' for they number one spot! (Alright man)
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say what?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! Causin' lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards
These women tryin' yo get me out my Pelle Pelle
They strip off my clothes and tell me, "Get in my belly!"
Stay on the track, hit the ground runnin' like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time and I've never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen ah, boys and girls
Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world! Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Alright)
Rappers swearin' they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)
But I'm comin' for they number one spot! (Alright man)
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say what?)

So come on now and get up to it y'all The incredible, untouchable nigga spittin' venom out his body wit' the dopest flows
And wonder why the line's around the corner
Cause the little motherfucker has the dopest shows
So one time for my independent women and all the single mothers who be gettin' that cake
Two times for my dogs pullin' triggers
And my niggaz in the kitchen that be flippin' that weight
East coast, west coast, mid west, dirty south
Then we took it all around the world
I got fans in retirement homes, to teenagers, to little bitty boys ans girls
Droppin' lyrical bombs up in ya' hood,
Non-stoppin', I'ma hit 'em till the block explode
Hip hop, R&B;, Pop-tart, what you want?
I even got a little rock 'n' roll
The most creative, original, got 'em takin' subliminal Cause they can't get what I got's
They want it so bad, four million dollar pad
And enough to retire off two albums, gone, wave ya' white flags, I'm hot!
And everytime I rhyme I'm puttin' rappers in the ground
Wit' lines that got 'em hooked like dope
They gotta make up they mind, because they runnin' outta time
And I'm about to make 'em choke
Better turn your stereo louder, listen up and let me preach
Let's get arrested for Disturbin' the Peace! (C'mon) Man! This Disturbin' Tha Peace shit gettin' on my nerves
Boy I tell you the truth, know what I'm sayin'?
While he doin' shows, I'm in these streets, know what I'm sayin'?
While he on tv, I'm in these streets
And then my broad, my kid walkin' around singin' it
Boy, if they sing another verse, boy I swear
Know what I'm sayin'? I'm on another level though
I gotta car wash, I gotta shop on O' National
I got my own record label, you heard of us
The Posse Family Cartel, you know what I'm sayin', we real
Who this nigga thing he is? I'ma house hold name, wit' game spittin' outta my mouth at all times
I spit it out and about, and spit outta the south,until they recognize the danger signs
So feel a tingle in yo' s-spine, by the way I talk
And it's pimpin' in my blood, you can tell by the way I walk
Oh lawd, more styles than a barber shop, call the cops
People in the way want to baller block
Little do they know that I'm callin' shots
And I'm not to be fucked with
If you see me comin' 'round the corner, then duck quick, perpetrators can suck dick
I tried to tell 'em, but they don't want to listen
I tried to shine 'em, but they don't want to glisten, while the high hat keeps on tickin'
And the kick drum keep on pumpin', I'm dumpin' on the closest fools
Cause rules were made to be broken, but you can't make broken rules
Hear what I'm sayin' or heard what I said
Hear what they playin', 'cause through this music I'ma still be heard if I'm dead
Call ya' producers, 'cause I'm hurtin' these beats
I said it once, I'll say it twice, biatch, Disturbin' Tha Peace

The King of the kings has spoken

Rep yo side and throw it up Po' it up and it's goin' down
Light another blunt and it's goin' round
Puff, puff pass you can toast yo glass
Later we'll screw and slow it up If you make it fast, I can make it last
And I'm a nigga that's makin' cash
Eight figures in the bank and I pull yo rank
What you thank with ya hatin' ass Hehehehehe, you think you fly, I know you not
Hehehehehe, you tote yo knife, I tote my glock Big body Cadillac, women in the backseat,
Speakers steady pumpin' as I pass these losers
Yo car too small, why? Cause I can't fit my women in a PT Cruiser
Get ya cake up, get ya weight up way up to the top 'til u can't go further
These snitches is after my riches and yes I smell bloody murder When I cock back with a drop dat can't block dat lock dat fools betta stop dat
Otherwise you can pop back
But after dumpin a round you'll be wonderin' where the cops at
Where the cops at? Cause I'm drunk as fuck
Tell 'em I'm far from sober
Cause if the po po happen to pull me over
I'm a just tell 'em [Chorus:Repeat x4] Ay Luda, you know niggaz over here, over here kushed out, iced out nigga G's
Up nigga, it's Scrappy, O-K-K-KAY!
E'rybody with me, bitches lookin tipsy, goons posted up case a hater try to tempt me
Pull out the roach, roll up the dough, money I'ma throw again holla at my folk
All I need is a bitch right now, to blow me away then take me down
I need another fuckin Conjure round, hot wing, Gucci, out to the lounge
You might just see me but I can't dig deep nigga with gold teeth
Nigga then O-D on VSOP, and if not now slowly but surely
Shake 'em like LeBron, shoot 'em like Kobe, if they say chill I just pay the police
In the club chillin with G-S-U-P, but after go down it's in D.T.P.
That's a rock, got you pissy and you dizzy, wanna hit me
But not really, please don't mix me, I'm a boss, my dogs bite quickly
If nobody's out here with me I'ma do this shit myself
Smoke and drink off for my health like I don't need nobody else
Scrap's so true to smokin crucial, swishin on swishas with Luda
I'm, in the Playas Circle, this G shit you hoes ain't used ta
I got my own kush pack and got my own liquor
"Ay what you call that?" I call it Cleveland
Now nigga! [Chorus:Repeat x7] I know everybody remember their first time
No matter how old you are
You gotta remember that very first time you did something man Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories (I remember, I remember)
Ain't nothing like the first time (ok)
or how things used to be (how they used to be girl)
Ain't nothing like the first time (hey mom I'm coming in I won't be too late)
remembering the memories(the green lights come on)
Ain't nothing like the first time (I gotta have your ass home)
or how things used to be Ok, come travel with me down memory lane
Back in my wonder years when nobody considered me sane
First time I got a whooping 'sRight where I begin
Cuz what I did I told my mom I'd never do it again
Round four years old and young Luda's a menace (yep)
But I cried the first time I had to go to the dentist
Cuz I was scared then a mug, I couldn't stand no doctors
But I loved getting drunk my first time off vodka (oh yeah)
'Til the very next morning I was hung on over (uh huh)
Proceeded to throw upon my grandma's sofa
It was nasty, I swore I wouldn't take another sip
The first time getting high I had to take another hit
It wasn't working at first then I started tweaking
Back seat of my boy's ride just laughing for no reason
Been rappin' since I was seve, I remember the time
Plus I wrote my first son when I was nine
And ain't nothing like the first time Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be Oh, you gotta go, you gotta get your ass out
Cuz im my momma come home, well she's likely to pass out man
That's what I said about my bust my first nuts
Cuz all through grade school we tried to bust the first slut
That we could geto our hands on, sex never last long
After sixty seconds tell that trick to put her pants on
It smell like badussy, and I don't like that
I'm about to call her four eyes and I'll be right back Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be I got memories in the corner of my mind
Misty watered colored memories, thinking bout the first time
That I learned how to ride my bike
And the first time I got into a fight
Or it could have been the first time
I got my heart broke by this girl I like
My first time to Atlanta was my first time on a plane
My first time on ecstacy I stood out in the rain
My first time getting grain I was in the backseat of Rudy car
The first time I stole was a sky box, basketball cards, and a candy bar
The first time I heard the legend, we robbed the dope boy
We got about thirty grand out
I was fifteen years old and in high school
And I had to tall Willy every look stand out
First everything, home brewing, bitch swing
Like Micheal when he won his first championship ring
And he cried with the trophy, that's like my first rhyme
First check for rapping on back for the first time
First met Quincy Jones, he said I looked like Snoop
I remember when me and Chris were in a group Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be And I had to tell Willy every look stand out
