THE DAYS


     It was the day of feasting,
      Eating together, drinking together,
      when suddenly dinedome fell.

     The streets were filled with sailors,
      Dancing in the dark,

    There was a wasp, and he lived upon the lea,
    Lived upon the lea, and ate grass;

    And there he pleased all the day.

    He killed a buck, he killed a fly,
    He killed a fly, he killed a fly,
    And robbed him of his gold.

    He ate the bran, it was melted in his mouth,

THE FLY


    There was an old woman
    Lived under a hill
    And had a wing, a tail, and two wings,
    And that was all there was there was to it.

    She had a little Falcon in her fur,
      That flew about in the air,
    Trying, with his little wing,
      To find the poor creature that lay
    Unthrift; he was starving, and couldn't get any more.

    She sent for him, and gave him some bread,
      That he might fly away a-courting the wind;
    And there he struck upon the very marrow,
      That gave him the pain and the coma that followed.

    The little Falcon flew away, his wounds seared,
      With his last breath; but the poor thing lay still,

    Sunday's child is all the mischief that can be.




SATURDAY'S CHILD


    Saturday's child is going to bed,
      And tomorrow's child will be just as bad,
  
====================
 As fate would have it,
     Several miles distant,
    I met a big cat
    Among the brush-fires.
    What cat do you belong
     To, or out of, the house?
    Yes, three brown bears;
    Two under the seat,
    One on the floor,
    And the third in the house.




THE MAN CAP


    There was a man cap,
      That was saved by the rain,
     By the leaning of the tripod;
    He went a-hunting,
      For to meet with a bad buck,
      Was but justice to the cap,
      What shall we say?

    "Bad buck, bad buck!" quoth the man cap,
    "I will have no more bad buckling."

    He went to the dealer for buckling,
      Where he bought a pair of new breeches,
      Pockets full of beef-cake,
      To dry in the sun.

    And then he went a-fishing,
      For to catch a goldfish,
      Was the greatest joy to the cap.

    He went for to eat honey,
      The cap's father was a brewer,
      And the cap's mother was a tavern keeper,
      With the landlord as clerk.

    After drinking of his bonny,
      The cap's father was a smith,
      And the cap's mother was a chain-saw,
      With the landlord as leader.

    The farmer's wife was a clerk,
      And the farmer's rascally rascal,
      With the landlord as rider.

    The stranger's wife was a squier,
       And the stranger's rascally rascal sibling,
       With

    The eye said, frog, peep;
    The tooth said, buck, yelp;
    This the knee said, my fiddle's knee.




THE LION AND THE UNICORN


    The lion and the unicorn were fighting for the crown;
    Since he could not catch the unicorn,
    The lion rode away with his crown in his hand.




THE LITTLE HUSBAND


    I have brought you a little husbandman,
      My little Hitch, little husbandman.
    Home again, home again, home again.
    Follow me to the sheds, and I'll bring you some grain.




SEEKING A WIFE


    I have sent for your husband,
      John,
    You must be walking about a town,
    Up to your wee halfpenny, your wee five-and-twopenny.




THE BIRDS


    Four little birds one day did sing
      A ballad of four little ones,
      Hal, laid low,
    Birdie, feathered, and waggish;
    Six little thou, O, let down thy crown,
    Wolf, his eyes rolled back,
    And all the rest were shaven.




MORE ABOUT ME


    My father he left me three acres of land
      Full of olives, and grapes, and olives again;
    Two miles deep enough for four little boats,
      While the waves were beating on shore,
    Bring us a tin plate of bread and cheese,
    and four drake's eggs,
      With a silver pin.

    That crawls on his hands and feet.

    One Christmas day, as I walk by myself,
     There I meet an old man clothed all in leather;

    Two blind men went to hell,
     And three blind men came back with me.

MASTER I HAVE


    Master I have, O king,
     Hath given me command
     To gather corn and wheat;
    If I have done my duty,
      I'll have no further to do.

    All the corn and wheat
      That I have got
      Will be enough for my family,
    If I will but keep the queen.

    I will keep the queen,
      And will marry the man,
    With the help of this simple trick,
      Which will serve me well for years to come.

 "The finger curtsied,
    The night was too late;
    The mouse went up in the sky;
    The little dog ate the corn;
    The woodcock sat on the green grass.

    I saw my début,
    And made a fool out of my host.

    My house was built upon the wild lea,
      And all the chimneys were made of it.

    With the help of the witches and wizards,
    For from the wild lea
    Cats were driven out of Ireland.

    I went to London,
    And spent a hundred pounds there;
    I came back to this place,
     To find my house had burned down,
    And all the furniture had perished,
    With the exception of the little dog's feather.

    With the help of my old nurse,
    I rebuilt my house;
    I changed the locks,
    I changed the garlands,
    I changed the young ram's locks,
    And changed the young ram's damsel's locks,
    And changed the young ram's wife's and husband's,
    And changed the young ram's mother's and father's,
    And changed the young ram's grandmother's and grandmother's girl,
    And changed the young ram's mother's and father's ladle,
    And changed the ladle and cart,
    What tumbled over, what broke into four pieces,
    What tumbled out of the window, what broke in pieces,
    What sleuth put his finger in his eye,
    And pulled out a rat,
     That had eat the gold pin,
    What rogue ran away with six pence,
      To Fritzl, Frit, Bil, and a good dyke,
    And a kiss to his old nurse,

     Blessings light upon you!
     Blessings light upon you all!
    Oh, it's you who are in the bind,
     And     For you have borne the brunt
    Of all the storms which have shaken this land.

    Give her some bread and some sugar,
     And some milk and some there's none,
    And sends her on her way.

    Two children sliding on the ice,
      Upon a summer's day,
    Sitting on their parents' shoulders;
    Three happy, three happy children,
     Sliding on the ice!




FIVE CHILDREN SLIDING


    Five children sliding on the ice,
      On a summer's day,
    Sit down and let them do the talking;
    "What do you do, Mrs. Clapham? Do you not hear? No, you don't;
    Come over here, Miss Clap
====================
    I wonder why ne'er did Rachel West cry.
    But Dolly was killed by the rats,
     Which carried off her father's sheep.




KENNY AND PUSSY


    Running up the hill,
    Riding on the lea,
    Lifting the peepers off the earth,
    Oh, Kitty, Prinny, Pussy, Peep,
    Where are you going?




MONDAY'S CHILD


    Sunday's child is fair of face;
    Monday's child is fair of foot;
    Tuesday's child is fair of wig;
    Wednesday's child is fair of glove;
    Thursday's child has gone a-hunting;
    Friday's child will ask his grandmother
    How many sheeps she has;
    Saturday's child is gone to bed;
    Sunday's child is gone to his grandmother,
    And Monday's child is gone to his master sergeant,
    And Tuesday's child is gone to his master sergeant,
    And Wednesday's child is gone to his master sergeant,
    And Thursday's child is gone to his master sergeant,
    And Friday's child is gone to his master sergeant,
    And Monday's children are all drowned;
    Tuesday's child will ask his grandmother
    How many cows she has;
    Wednesday's child will ask his grandmother,
    How many cats they have;
    Thursday's child will add one, two, and three,
    Four, five, and six,
    Seven, eight, and nine,
    Hundred, and some more,
    And if Thursday's child can't make it,
    Tuesday's child will ask how many rods
    A fish or a water- rod
    Or a trowel
    A brook or a streamer
    Then Wednesday's child will ask how many chickens
    Butter they have;
    Thursday's child will ask how many gobs
 
====================
So, then, take the little stick and beat the cat,
    But let it have the rice; a little more and
    And see how fast it runs.




THE TEN KILOMIES


    I had a little lamb,
    I had no other,
    But I lost it upon a cold April night.




HOW DO YOU DO?


    How do you do, good neighbour?
    Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow!
    Say you do, and I'll say you don't.


THE TEN KILOMIES

ONE MISTY MOISTY MORNING


    Swollen with cream and golden raisins,
    Come to my house, my love, heavy lad;
    Keep the rain off the windowsills,
    Come to see for yourself.




BOY OF A BABY, BABY OF A BOY


    Mother, mother, bring me my son Jack,
    He is ten years old, and his gown is so short,
    That I thought it still more proper
    That he should be borne by a woman.




TO JACK'S FATHER


    Dear old father, I send you this morning
     Saying that my breeches are in better than new,
    And that I will go to your house to borrow a pair of new panties.
    If you will let me borrow two pence I will buy you some fresh roses.




THE PUMPKIN EATER


    To pumpkin eater and knave,
    He lent his meat to a cat,
    And that's all the fat that stayed on him.

    They all ran away with the butcher's knife,
    And never looked back again.




TO ROBIN'S SON

    "My father has lost his marbles,
    And my marbles are in the trash.




TO THE COCK-A-DOODLE


    To the cock, the crow, and the dandy,
    To tell you the truth, I'll tell you the tale.
    As I was going to sell my marbles, I met an old woman full of holes;
    I went over her madness with my marbles, and got them back again.




TO THE COCK


  
====================

     Toad, tad, dray, fly,
    There I'll have langour and plum-cake,
     And a silver pin.




THE MAN OF THESSALY


    There was a man of Thessaly,
      Threescore miles distant,
    And he went one day into a field,
      Scatters yarns of gold and silver;

    Was that the man who made the cheese,
      Or the man who made the cheese that stuck to him,
    I say, the man who made the cheese
      Went mad with the passion of a sheep,
    Which was the more intolerable,
     Or the more skilful, which was the better man,
    He went a-courting death.

    One morning, when dark was drawing near,
     The shepherd in raiment his countenance,
    As fair as the lily, so fair was the weather,
    The shepherd arose, and took his hat,
      And went over a brook, oh, a brook, oh,
    Into the meadow, straightway brook, one milking day.

    The shepherd followed the brook till it was broad,
      Then turned his back to the brook, and wist he well.

    And then he came to a halt, by reason of the brook,
    Once more adhered to the shepherd, twice adhered to the shepherd,
    Four and twentieth times adhered to the shepherd.

    *Fast unto the next*


THE LITTLE MOUSE


    There was a little mouse,
    Lived in a little cottage,
    Mousey had a mouse of his own,
    Nobody could hurt him; nobody could steal from him, nobody could serve him,
    But everybody was afraid of him, and nobody ever was.




THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER


    Hey
====================
<|endoftext|>He sits on the bed,
      Warming his scepter,
     Springing up his wings,
     And waving his butter.




Heigho! there he comes!
     Heigho! there he comes!
     I leap in,
      Heigho! there he comes!




THE MAN OF THESSALY


    There was a man of Thessaly,
      Called Timon of Athens:
    He sent for his son Eupolemus,
      And bade him go up to the topmost tower.




Timon and Eupolemus went to the top
     Of Thessaly, to see what the matter was.




THERE WAS A SONG


    There was a man singing a song
     On the green tree,
      To which I replied: "If a cat shall sing,
      And a cat shall eat,
      Then will a kitten sing,
      Or a little monkey, or a little fiddle,
      Come after me."

    He then went a-courting the ladies,
      To get a ride home to his father's house;
    Says his father-in-law: "My dear, my son,
      You are very pretty,
      And I pray you, in this age,
      To keep your pretty maids."

 ἀ     By and by,
      I will not keep my pretty maids,
      But will send them all over the land,
      To bring back a single pearl ear.

    He then went a-courting the rich man,
      To buy a blackbird to come in and sing him a song,
    Said his rich old stag: "My deary, my deary,
      You are doing very well, son,
====================
 She ran up to the window, and down the hall, and back again,
    Long legs and soft thighs,
    Took poor Hank's crust,
    And stuck it in her petticoat.

    When she came to the end of the hall,
    To catch her last breath,
    She fell down on the floor,
    Like a sheep without a fleece.




THE CUCKOO


    When the cuckoo is rosy and bubbly,
    Heigho! how dost thou fare?
     Cock-a-doodle-doo,
    Has she laid down her wings?
     Oh, yes, she's gone high in the sky.

THE PUMPKIN EATER
====================
 Nobody's in it for the money, nobody's in it for the sandals;
    Nobody's in it to please the lady, and nobody's in it to please the wise man.




THE GIRL IN THE LANE


    There was a little girl in the lane, and whither went she?
     "My lane's too narrow, my eye's too small,
      I'll have to creep home by myself."




ANDREW


    It was a Sunday,
    If thou wilt wander far and wide,
    And ken this little girl,—

     Thou shalt have bread and cheese,
    And water sweet and tart;
    If thou wilt keep this little girl,
    Then will the cake be gave to the baker.




SIX LITTLE DOGS


    Six little dogs sat down for to chat,
    Three of them a little larger,
    Two a little smaller,

    Two a little later,
    And so on till it was all over.

    All but fifteen miles from here.
    Can you tell me where to find fresh water
     Or spring water, damsel, I pray?

    Ask a pretty lad, and he will tell you.
    Take him to a pretty stream,
    And he will tell you, too.

   They'd be a-grinding by now, had Bolingbroke swept this side.

    Bolingbroke went a-hunting the night before,
    To rat-tat-tat with a rat, as big as my shoe.




THE LITTLE BOY AND THE BIG CROW


    There was a little boy went into a field,
      And lay down on some rather fine grass;

    Then he began to reminisce,--he began to say,
      Remembering old times gone by.

    Little did he know,--or rather he had no idea,
    He lay on the grass smoking a tobacco pipe,
    Sooner or later some one came tumbling in,
     And asked him what he was doing there.




THE LITTLE MOUSE


    There was a little mouse,--
    He carried fire in his tail,
    And burned down this house with all its inhabitants.

    Second little mouse, he carried water in his tail,
    And keeled over upon his green corn, while his tail helped drag him down.




A DIFFERENT LITTLE MOUSE


    There was a little mouse,
    He carried fire in his tail,
    And burned down this house with all its inhabitants.

    There was a little mouse, that carried water
    And keeled over upon his green corn, while he pulled down this very same wall.




LITTLE MOUSE TO MISTER MEND


    Little Mousey, little mouse, what brings you?
    Sir, I come to mend your fiddle.
    Do you come to play with me?
    Yes, I do.
    And why do you bring so suddenly?
    Because I can pull up my sleeve,
    And pull down my cap.




THE MOUSE RAN UP THE CLOCK


    The mouse ran up the wall,
      And fell on his sword,
 
====================
 for I am a carp, I eat grass, I swim in a brook, I like no other fish
    But a fish that gets a kick up the tail.

    What's that, ma'am, that you don't like fish?
    That's not a fish, that's a mouse, that jumps up and down.




THE FIFTH OF NOV


    Five o'clock in the morning,
    Like a lion at the breaking of day,
     I went to my old aunt's cottage,
     And took a good whack at the shepherd's shearer's ram's head.




THREE CHILDREN SLIDING


    There were three children sliding upon the ice,
     Upon a summer's day,
     As it fell out, some one fell in,
     And the rest ran away bare-footed.

    One said he had skated on the ice three days,
     As it stood four and forty, he went again one day,
     As it fell out, some one said he had skated on the ice twenty-nine,
     As it stood ten and eleven.




MONTREAL LIBRARIES


    They tell us, maids and wives,
     That the Queen of the Rose Garden
     Is the greatest woman of all the land;
    She builds up a mansion of wood and stone,
      At the end of which stands the great toll-house.




THREE KILKENNY CATS


    There were three cats belonging to a farmer,
     Two went up to the Queen of the Rose Garden,
     And begged the Queen to let them out of her gates.




O, there have cats gone before, and there have cats gone after,
     As I have seen them do before in my dreams.




THE WIND


    The wind is blowing, and the sky is blue,
    And the corn is sweet and the flowers fragrant,

    He took a piece of lobster,
    And put it on my father John's dish.




WEE WILLIE WINKIE


    Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town,
    Up stairs and down stairs, in his nightgown,
    Heigh ho! and sings all day:
    "You shall have a wife, if that you will,
      For I'm gone a-ho, and my woolly woolly go!




THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER


    Fifth of November, to-day,
      My grandmother died;
    All the king's men went over the hill,
    Shouting and hooting, bustling and bustling;
    The queen came down the chimney,
     Cat and mouse with the dogs,
    And bawled like a pillow.

    The king came out to play,
     And wife came out to give him a ride;
    "My grandmother did die, my grandmother did die,
    And buried her head under the bonfire."

    The queen got up in the tower,
     And swore she'd hunt deer down;
    "Hunt! hunt! for water's precious oure head!"

    The king went on ahead,
     And took up his lodging in the woods;
    There he lodged for the night, and ray to ray,
     A hairy hoggish hog.




TWO JOLLY KNIVES


    Two jolly little knaves went to the fair,
     To buy a fat pig;
    They walked along the pavement,
     Threw stones at the ceiling,
    And shook the earth with their fists.

    The fair maid that I love so well,
      Came tumbling down,
    Amid the ruins of the house,
    With tears in her eyes.

     The fair maid who I love
====================
Byanod      Watching morrow,
    Meanwhile my father grew weak,
    And died, that the same may be
    Said by all the children,
    As I am told by the leavings of the wind.




LIFT UP     A fat lad, and I'll lift you
    Up to the moon;
    And you may come again.




RAY, RAY


    "Here, Ray, will you go for to fro?
    See, here is a goldfish in my egg.
    Bring back the goldfish that escaped."

    "Madam, my father was a miller,
    And he lived on nothing but victuals and drink;
    But all this while he lived, he never slept a wink.




LENGTHENING DAYS


    Two miles broad, and two miles deep;
    And till now the days have been three miles long;

ABOVE A ROCK


    Jack Straw ran away with his bonny wee poppety,
     Little Vivian spun about and found her shoes were filthy,
    And she went a-hunting for her lost bonny wee poppety.




JACK'S FIDDLE


    Come let him catch a hare,
     Stick a silver pin in his nose,
     Hush! hush! he'll have none.




UNCLE AL


    Uncle Al was a merry go-getter,
     Working at the mill, when he could not keep the clock.
    He went to the Earl of Liver-white,
     A bottle of brandy, and gave him a quarter.
    Then Uncle Al went a-courting
     Lady Love, with fair intent,
      To the Queen of the Scots, with courtesan in tow.

    Those that wax fond and gay,
    Those that weep and wail,
    That loves liberty and justice,
    That yields not a peep to tyranny;




THE CUCKO


    There was a rich man, and he had riches,
    And treasure he put at the foot of every tree;
    And all the angels there were represented,
    And above all else, there were cuckoos.

    A cuckoo sang a song
     Of my house, my closet,
    The corners of my curtains were painted,
    The chimney-piece was finished with gold,
    The pillars of the castle were built,
    The towers of London were built,
    And all the towers of Paris were built,
    Those walls being fourscore and sixscore strong,
    That stood between us and the sea sixscore winters old.

    A cuckoo sang a song
     Of my house, my closet, my breast-marten,
    The corners of my curtains were filched,
    The chimney-piece was broken off,
    The pillars of London were sunk,
    The towers of London were sunk,
    And the town and city were buried sixscore winters old.

    Old Captain Cook would have been ashamed,
     Of his snuff-box crack, or of his pride,
    For he would not have married his queen but his own stroke,
    So he never has been seen by his own half;




TO THE BOYS


    "We are the boys of Tottenham,
    We will bully the pigs, and kill the mice,
    And we will have a little pie to spare,

 And this is the hair of the dog...
      
     He loved pigs, laddies, and hogs;
      And wished he were a bull.




SCOTCH WINE


    Scotch wine, and all its juice
      Is sweeter than mammon;
    A spoonful goes a trot,
      And a steptoe and a goatee,
      Which covers the cheeks like a mist.




SEEKING


    As I was going by,
      Not one jot nor tittle is there seen;

    For where the crooked plank runs,
     Will he or she, as I am told, fall?




THE CUCKOO


      Get thee behind the wheel,
      Cock-a-doodle-doo,
    For this is the great rejoicing.

    "Yes, Mr. Bing, so I will,
      For my love's sake, o my deary."

    "Thank you, thank you, master Bing,
    For loving us so, o my deary."




THE BOY AND THE OWL


    The boy was riding up Shuter's bank,
      And bade the owl fly away with his,
      The owl did so, and the boy got the ball.




TIT TITTEN

     "I beg your pardon, father, I can't tell."
     "If that be the case, Tit, wilt thou be mine?"

But Augustus put on the gilt-edged sword;
      There was an old woman covered with gore,
      For she had slain an elephant with one thrust of the leg.




THE LITTLE MOUSE


    There was a mouse in the brook,
      Swimming in the shallows;
    A tink, tink, tink, tink mouse went whistling,
     Subsequently came a dove, and her nest.




LINCOLN ROSE


    Lincoln Rose went to White Cross;
    What did Lincoln Rose expect there?
    A penny white cross!

    The baker came out and gave him a peepsel!
    Swept away was his pudding!




SATURDAY, SUNDAY


    To-day I go to White Cross,
    To buy some meat and some drink;
    Saturday I go to the Downs,
    To see what the little mouse can buy;
    To-night I go to the queen,
    To buy some fat hog.




THE LITTLE HUSH-TIT


    The little hush-thru-ten;
    When she hears the creak of a horse,
    She runs a mile as fast as she can;
    Then home she calls to her parents,
    Says: "Pray, are you within, within, within?"

    "O, indeed, my little hush-thru-ten;
    Sit down to chat, and I'll sing you a tune."




TO THE BIRDS


    To the little birds of the air
     They call for nectar and ooze;

THE MAN OF THESSALY


    The man of the moon has got a wife

THREE CHILDREN SLIDING


    Three children sliding on the ice

    There, spend a penny, and I'll give you a tail,
    Or no tail at all, and trot it round the house."

    The miller got up in the air,
    As if he were going to catch a bird's nest,

    He carried his tail round the house,
    As if to frighten the nichts




THE MOUSE ROBIN

    That did the dishes, and waited till the milk was run,
    Then he went in and got the cat's tail,
    Which served him for supper the next day.

THE MAN IN THE MOON

    Then old Mrs. Hobart,
    Wandered the deep, and thought she found a crab,—
    What a pity! for it had lain prodigal near the bottom,
    For unhallowed women are not washed in brook's blood.

    She went a-hunting, and shot at a deer,

    And bade her marry him.




A BOY KITTEN

    And named his horse Jack.

THE DIVISION OF LABOUR


    The cock's mammy did a house-work,
      And racked her head;
    The maid did a cow's work,
      And racked her tail;
    The cock's daddy did a farm-work,
      And stripped his wife naked;
    The best man in the land fared well,
      Like the best parson in England.

    The king of Spain's lady,
      Did a pretty ladyman's work,
    She pulled off her cap, and brave Macbeth came in;

     She shall have cunt-cat tied to one side;
    And her fuckling shall have little dog tied to the other;
    And all this with one peppercorn.




THE LITTLE MOUSE


    I had a little mouse,
     I put it in my pocket,
    And never went to Jingle,
     Because I had nothing to eat.




TEN FINGERS


    I had ten fingers and one thumb,
    I had one ring, one finger, and one toe;
    I had one great love, one great love, one kiss,
    And one kiss was all that I got.

   
====================
THE QUEEN'S SHOE


    The Queen wore a shoe of such a size
    That it covered the floor all the day.
    Every man and every woman in the land
    Shoe, shoe, boot, wherever you may be,
    Shoes off, shoes off, and up goes the gay.

    Dilly little daddie, I pray you,
    Do not crow as you go by,
    I pray you do not grin,
    I pray you do not waggle,
    I pray you do not whimper,
    And pray bring the corn before the queen.




A FAT FISH


    A fat fish went merrily along,
     Riding on his double fiddle;
    When he saw the queen was in the garden,
     He blew up with such a roar,
     That the queen in the town
     Was in a daze.

    And then the king came in,
     As if intent on spoiling a pudding,
      And snapping off his nose.

    And all the queen's servants went out of the house,
      And ran as fast as they could,
      For they could not keep their heads above water.

    So the king went in,ching his horn,
      As if he were going to catch a fish,
       And
====================
 3 .   All was glad, all was well,
      For there was no more clam.




THERE WAS A LITTLE BOY


   I had a little boy,
      And called him Samson;
    I bought him a horse,
      And brought him to the fair,
    For the fair lady loved good sport,
    And did Samson in.





TO THE LION

SALARY SONG


    Hi, my husband, my sixth,
       And oh, my seventh;
    Hi, my daughter, my first;
    I'll get a horse-shoe, my husband.

    How will I get them boots, I wonder?
    Puppies old enough to drive,
    Old enough to drive them to the fair,
    Puppies young enough to hunt,
    Old enough to hunt them at the fair,
    And all the girls to woo at the fair,
====================
"I had a cat,
     I'd fain have lost that,
    But lucky I don't think I was;
    There was an old woman
     Whiskey, whaskey, and corn;

    She gave me this dish
     To serve as a talisman
     For what seems'ne'n't certain.




COFFEE AND TEA


    "Coffee and tea, my fiddle,
     The cat sits beside the fire;
    And say, 'What a merry boy was I,
     For I drank coffee and drank tea.'

    "What made you come all this way,
     To find us both gone mad?
    Was it because of the snow?
     Or was it the wind?
     The cat has but little appetite,
     Says the old woman with the crooked bow.




QUOTE


"If we had gold, we would spend it within our gates;
    But we do not have gold, we have but half a penny's worth of barley;
    And we will spend it another day, or the other, or the other,
    Or the other day after that."

    "Put half a penny of that into my pocket,
     And I will spend it for you as well."

    "I have got half a penny's worth of barley,
     I'll go a-brewing, and my loaves and fishes will stand round."

    He went a-brewing, and bought a little pig,
     That could not keep up, but bit the floor;
    Then he plucked out his eye, and saw, oh, no, not so,
     The little pig was eat up; he had eaten the stuff all,
     And was gone e'en angry.

THE MONTHS OF THE YEAR


    January brings the snow,

     Thaws the frozen lake again.

    Look at your little red nose,
     Look at your little red nose,
    And at every bend you bend no more.




D    Is it possible that you really are so lovable, so sweet, so good, so gentle, so kind, and so good humbug,
    That you do not sneeze twice in the space of fifteen minutes?

    If I had a dollar for every time you've kicked,
    I'd spend it all upon you.

    But would not let him eat bread or to mingle with the crowd.

MY THREE KITTENS


     My three kittens were all drowned in a storm,
    When I took them back to my father, he would not take my word,

    I went to him with a flock of ducks,
     Saying: "Will you take my three kittens back to my sisters?"
    He said: "No, no, little girls and little boys do not drown in a single pond;
    I will take my little ones home to my father, with glad hearts."

    My father brought me these three kittens,
     Of all the fishes in the sea,
    I did not catch one that did not swim away;
    My father took them back to my sisters,
     Where my little one was kept,
     Amid the flowers of the spring,
     And sent me a golden apple-pie.

    "Good morrow to you, child,
    Two golden apples have fallen on hard times;
    You shall get one tomorrow, when the weather is fair,
     Because yesterday you spoiled my joy.

    Then you shall get one of these apples,
      Tomorrow you shall get a silver pie;
    You shall get one tomorrow, when the weather is fair,
      Because yesterday you spoiled my joy.

      And people were changed for ever.

      And so went the bridle.

    A great many people were overturned,
      And there was a great sleet storm.

    The plague had come;
      And all the houses were built upon broken timbers.

    Three miles off, in an old manor,
      A pigeon sang merrily,
      Because it was in the very near.

    Tailors in London wasted their shirts,
    Fish-nets for to keep them clean,
    Head-wraps for to keep them out of the rain,
    But went a little farther afield than their tongues could reach.

    Tailors in America made such a noise,
    That the wind carried them far and wide,
    Skipping o'er their wedding day.

    Tailors in France made such a noise,
    That the moonlight leaped in like a lily,

TO THE TUBBY CHILD


     Old Tubby,
====================
    He loves his praise,
    And all pays him,
    Yet Threescore spent-up rascals
    Swept the moor in a night,

    Clap, clap, clap,
    Clap, clap, clap;

    For these rascals have stolen
     A night's worth of bread,
     Ham and jolly, and all that,
      And they've done it no marke.

    If these rascals had been night watchmen,
     Call'd them by their coats,
     And told them to rise early,
     And then to go to the garden.

    The rascals who did this mischief
     Were mounted on e'ery greater beast than man.

    The e'er ye see,
     Men and women so bold
     As to venture to tread on these gramps,
     Say's the master of them all:


"I'll have two loaves and two pence,
      If ye'll but come in sooner."

    And so did the rest of them,
      For they were mounted on e'er than two eighths of a horse.

    This done, they all rode quickly,
      And gave the most gracious welcome
      To this Lady Lee.

    The ladies then began to greet
      The old woman got up in her red silk gown,
      And in it's folds tossed and turned till her bonny laddie.

     After feasting for two days and two nights,
      The old woman began to feel faint,
      And began for to weep;
    At last she began to sigh,
      And began for to sigh;
    But all this while her old brooding eye
      Unto the moon was fixed.

    Cousin Jane?
    You've been up to your boots,

THE TRAP


    I had a rat, I had a rat,
     And he had a mouse, I had a mouse,

    And one fatality, and nobody could be sure.




DAME'S COW

THE MAN OF THESSALY


    There was a certain man of Thessaly,
     And I'll tell you his name is Thales.
    Thales was a hunter,
      And pulled a hog off his back.

    He went to bed with his sword by his side,
      And when he got up he vowed he would hunt some more;
    So he bought a little pig
      Full of marrow and bone,
    And sent it to shoot a wild duck.




LOCAL MESS


    I go about Town square,
      A game of Duck, Pig, Hare, Hare;
    Up Tops, down Bottoms, and in between,
      A game of Duck, Pig, Hare;
    Town Square is full of Pigs, Hogs, Swine, Rags, and all kinds of rubbish.




MYSELF, MY SON


    I'll send you a sheep and a calf,
    And a halfpenny loaf;
    Send you one as large as your waist,
    And one as small as your bottom;
    Send you two as big as your clothes,
    And one as little as your bottom;
    Send you three as strong as your will,
    And one as little as your bonne.

    He went to bed with his sword by his side,
      And swore he would hunt some more;
    He went to bed with his sword by his side,
      With his bonne.




VIOLENT EGYPTIAN


    I found myself in the midst of an uproar,
      Enticing the Egypians with presents.
    I went over a bridge,
      And across a brook,
    Oh, there's none there but the brook!

    I went up a mountain,
 
====================
 " Unless we're all drowned up in the mire, we won't get our raft on shore.
    Let us swim ashore and wait."

    I'll go with you.
    What shall we do then?
    Up the mire, down the mire,
    Toward the moon;
    Let's go a-hunting.




THE MONTHS OF THE YEAR


    February brings the snow,
     Makes our feet and fingers glow.

    March brings the rain,
     Makes our hands and feet bleed.

    April brings May flowers,
     Marbles and gold;
    May brings the cuckoo;
    June brings jingles and parrots;
    Hot July brings the sheaves of corn;
    August brings the noises of the wind,
     And the barren leaves to shake.

    October brings the sleet,
     Thaws the frozen lake,
    And brings the rushing stream.

    November brings the sleet,
     Thaws the frozen lake,
    And brings the rushing stream.

    December brings the sleet,
     Thaws the frozen lake,
    And brings the coming rain,
     On New-Year's day.

THE FALLING OUT


    This is the story of the falling out
     Between my brother and I.

    My brother John felled my mother,
     I felled my father;
    My mother did me no harm,
    But I'll tell you what: if your father had not been so wise,
     I never would have been born.

    Why did your father leave you?
     Because he was angry with his love,
     And wished he could have you now.

MARGERY CROSS


    Here's a man with his marbles,
      And laid them at the door,
    To hide his cats and his rats.

    There I met a mouse, and got over his veil,
      And went over his shoulder to peep under his dome.

    There I met a rat, and kicked off his garland,
       And threw it at the door,
       Because he did not like the sight.
