======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 one of your kids
I don't even give a fuck
You just sit back and watch tv in the back
Back that up, back it up
Baby we live inside a dream, can't get a 'er on the block
I'm a grown man, I gotta go get my grown man on
I can't see shit, so I had to take a bath
And after I washed my vision, was more into color
Than being black, now that's where my interest will take me
Black in, black out, you just got it hooked up
You think you're all that and you ain't no angel
You gotta let me grow
Don't play the hand I was dealt, or I will grow
You ain't no angel, but you sure as hell got my attention
You ain't no angel, but you sure as hell grown
You ain't no angel, but you sure as hell grown
You ain't no angel, but you sure as hell grown
You ain't no angel, but you sure as hell grown
You ain't no angel, but you sure as hell grown
You ain't no angel, but you sure as hell grown
You ain't no angel, but you sure as hell grown
You ain't no angel, but you sure as hell grown
You ain't no angel, but you sure as hell grown
You ain't no angel, but you sure as hell grown
You ain't no angel, but you sure as hell grown
And you ain't no angel, I'm just saying it's different, it's different
Cause you don't really wanna find out the hard way
Yeah I had to get myself checked out, like, why do you guys think?
I mean what's good in this world, what's good in this world, what's good in this world?
When you get it, what you got?
Everything you think you know doesn't come with a price Tag
He keeps his women completely naked and has sex with at least one on three
I never had a woman hit me with nothing but a couple of strings
You may not like your new thing, but I just don't dig into the details
Clips, too many to watch, man all of them clips
Have us all having fun, oh we gotta do 'im all 'im, it's too much fun I was raised in Staten Island, Queens
Where they hang off of subways, where you watch 'em kick it with a submachine gun
And while I was growing up, got caught up in the gangsta lifestyle
Which is why up until I was a teen, I used to, umm, trade in my bling for a couple of bands
Side tho', I always told my nina, give me more
And every once in a blue moon, I'll shine, I'll cause trouble
And my crew, we gonna, we gonna, be the baddest
We gonna, we gonna, be the baddest
They ain't no pushovers, they ain't no creeps
They ain't no push-ups, they ain't no Fads They gon' hit them on their ass cheeks thatchass, yeah
Yea, like an Oreo, yeah
Oreo, yeah, I mean I like it, love it
I mean if it tickles in the middle like an ear
I like to make 'em ticklish, like an overbite
I make 'em beg for it, make 'em hard pushback
But I be on time, I be on time they be on time
I am the black Lisa, with my long brown hair, with so many locks
I am in the ghetto, and the best bitches in the club
I like to get them on cam and I like to tickle them
I like to get them wet and then I turn 'em wet again
I like to get them hard, long-john locks, that ticklish
Like an overbite, like an ear, I like to make 'em hard pushback
And I be on time, I be on time they be on time
I am the black Lisa, with my long brown hair, with so many locks I like to get 'em ticklish, I like to tickle 'em with my long-john locks, I like to get 'em wet, I like to get 'em high, I like to get 'em high
I like to get 'em high, I like to get 'em high, I like to get 'em off, I like to get 'em off, I like to get 'em off, I like to get 'em off, I like to get 'em off, I like to get 'em off
So put 'em on the floor, ticklish, ticklish, ticklish, ticklish I like to get 'em off, get 'em off, get 'em off, get 'em off,
