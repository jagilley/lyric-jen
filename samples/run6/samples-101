    And that they have done well or well for them.

    And yet still they say they have never eaten of the table.

     And yet still they say,
     "Oh! let us eat
    Of the flesh of the boars!"

    
   He laughed a good while,
       When they said so.

    But they were mad and could not bear it;
    To be sure, if they had been
        Of the flock of sheep,
    There was none o'er their heads.

    With a sigh they all parted,
     And left him to sing,

       Of a tune that his tongue knew




IF THERE WASN'T AN ILLUMINATE DUMPLING


    The house is built upon a hill,
       And all the houses are built upon hills,
    As I. C. F. say.

    All the houses over the hill
      Were built on stilts,
    As I. C. F. say.

    Two brothers were in their houses,
        And they could not stand still;
    They got down on their faces;
    And said, "We'll not stand still,
         Or else one of us shall burn."




THE JUDICIOUS LAW OF NOBLE FOOD


    The proverb that I have heard, and that I have always heard,
        Is "Don't take any
    With a dirty tongue, and dirty eye,"
    "For God's sake should we live in this land,
    With a dirty tongue, and dirty eye,
    But 't won't do, will it."

   That proverb I hear all the night long,
       With a dirty hand,
        As well as with a dirty eye;
    That proverb I hear all the evening long,
       With a dirty foot,
        As well as with a dirty tongue.




IN CASE OF CIRCUMSTANCES,
        My mind is so full, as is my soul (what shall I say?);
    So I'm not at peace with myself.
       But I'm glad to be at peace with God.
    With all my heart I thank him.




OLD WIFE FOUND


    When old wife found me
    Under a hill,
   I cried out,
       For the love of father and mother,
    My old husband found
    A way by to make me
    Out of prison.




ONCE UPON A CHRISTMAS DAY


    I went to Santa Claus's house
    Where were you all that time?
   I sat in a corner
       Warming my feet.

    I went to the chimney
    And threw up my snowballs;
   I went to the barn
    And dug a hole
    For a horse to stand in,
   With a plank in his right leg.




I WISH I KNEW


    I wish I knew
    What this country was made of
        And what this people
    Did all in one day.




SING A SONG OF SALT


    I sang a song of salt
    On the hillside,
    With an old woman as my lark,
        And all the cattle were gone.

     I sang a song of salt
   In a cottage in the village,
    When I walked the dogs
    With a stick in their mouth,
       And all the dogs ate up the salt.
