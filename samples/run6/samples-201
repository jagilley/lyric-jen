======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 old      He was a merry-making fellow,       He went to buy a tail,
      When he came to the door,
       He jumped out,
       And started after the tail.

    The tail got a peep,
       Which made Johnny's hair stand on end
    As white as pancake, pancake, and then pass it on.

    When Johnny got home,
       His hair stood on end,
       And he said something to the effect
    I do not like you very much.




POOR OLD BABY OLD BABY


    Old Baby Old Baby


    Come let us in,
    Let us in,
    Let us in,
    Let us in,
    We'll have salt and butter
    And eat of it without any more.




THE LITTLE MOUSE


    I have seen you, little mouse;
    Rise, and go,
    Take a little frosty bite,
    Little Sister Little Mouse,
    Let us out,
    Let us out,
    Let us out,
    We'll have ice-cream soon;
    If it won't keep,
    Then it shall."

    Now baby,
      If there be one thing you don't,
    I'll find it for you.




CATS ALL OVER THE STREET


    Cats all over the street,
    Up stairs and down stairs,
    Down stairs and round the corner,
      Cat, cat, jump off stile!
    If you could jump off a stile,
    What would you get?
    A penny, or a halfpenny,
    Or a little bit under the weather,
    If you could jump off a weather-beaten hill,
    What would you get?




JACK'S PIG


    Jack's pig had a mother,
      And he couldn't tell her from him;
    He'd kill her, and kill her soon,
      And then he wouldn't have any meat to eat;

    Jack's mother came to him,
      And threw him out of the window.
    As he fell to the ground,
      He rolled up his eyes,
    And then they all passed away.




TAFFY WAS A WELSHMAN


    Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief;
    When Taffy got a little pig,
      He took it home to his mother,
      And beat her a little,
    And knocked her down into a pit.
    When Taffy got to his mother,
      She started, but Taffy could catch him;
    Then they both got home without harm,
      And gave the beggar twenty shillings as a compliment.
    Then the stranger in the hamlet
      Saw what he could, and came to Taffy's help,
    Resolving at once
      His pockets to fill.

    His mother had got a little pig,
       Taffy had stolen some barley,
    Taffy came back and stole more barley,
    Running through the streets, alleys, and alleys
      Up to his mother's father,
    The beggar fired his pistol, but Taffy dodged away.
    Then his mother got a little pig,
       Taffy had stolen some beef,
    Beef Taffy? Yes, that was the name he picked up,
    And going to the butcher and buying him some chops,
    He went to the baker's and buying him some bread,
    Bread Taffy? Yes, that was the name he picked up,
    And going to the baker's and buying him some wine
