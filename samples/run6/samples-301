======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 I
    I plucked a swallow from the sea;
    And it was all right, I think,
      But the little boy he did me the shame.

    He tried to bite me, but he could not get a hold
      Of my top lip; so now, good sir,
      See, where's the little boy that bit me?
    He tried to pull off my clothes, but he could not manage
      My bottom jumper.

    See, see, what does the little boy that bit me get?
    Twenty shillings and eight pence.




THREE SHIPS


    I saw three ships come sailing by,
      Sailing by, sailing by,
    I saw three ships come sailing by,
      On New-Year's day in the morning.

    I spent the following day at the wharf,
      Determined to get a good whirl;
    And the following day I spent the night,
    Moved by the thought that I had made a fine find,
      And spent the night like a good girl.




THE CROOKED SONG


    There was a crooked man, and he went a crooked mile,
    He found a crooked sixpence beside a crooked stile;
    He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse,
    And they all lived together in a house torn down to the ground.




A AND B AND SEE


    A and b and see,
    A and b and see,
    See, you have caught a fish alive,
    But you have killed it with a knife,
    Dead cat, dead mouse, dead cat!




A WARNING


    A and b and see,
    B and see,
    See, you have caught a cat alive,
    But you have killed it with a gun,
    The bullet missed its mark,
    And the cat was shot through the head,
    The devil put it in a pig,
    The devil ran it through the middles,
    The devil shot it through the heart,
    And the devil jumped on top of it,
    And the devil got away with it.




IF


    If you are to be a gentleman, as I suppose you be,
    You'll neither marry, nor take any wife;
    And you will neither marry, nor take any wife.




DOCTOR FELL


    I do not like you, Doctor Fell;
    You're a dunce, you're a dunce,
    You don't know what you're doing,
    And yet you keep going.




THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER


    If you are to be a gentleman, as I suppose you be,
    You'll neither marry, nor take any wife;
    And you will neither marry, nor take any wife.




MY MAID MICE


    My maid mice
      Sat upon a shelf,
    With a penny in one paw,
    With a penny in the other,
    And a kiss in the other.






HUSH-A-BYE BABY


    Hush-a-bye, baby,
      On the tree top,
    When the wind blows,
      The cradle is lifted,
    And the child is in it,
      With a silver spoon in his mouth.




THE KING OF FRANCE


    The King of France
      Went up the hill,
    With three thousand men,
      Upon a sudden,
    The moon was as bright as noon,
    And all the houses were made of glass.




THE LAW OF LABOUR


    The King of France
      Went up the hill,
    With three thousand men,
    And on a sudden
      The house was set on fire,
    And the chimney
