Many years from now.
Will you still be sending me a Valentine.
Birthday greetings bottle of wine.
If I'd been out till quarter to three.
Would you lock the door.
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four.
You'll be older too,
And if I say the word,
I could stay with you.
I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday morning go for a ride,
Doing the garden, digging the weeds,
Who could ask for more.
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four.
Every summer we can rent a cottage,
