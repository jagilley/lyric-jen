======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 sleeping together tonight
We can work it out And when somebody loved me like me
She touched me like a man
I didn't know what to make
She told me what to say
I had to learn
Before she show me her room
Oh, she has a million hooks
By the way, she put me down
If I'm being watched
I will not say anything but leave it
And when somebody loved me like me
She told me that she love me too
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"It's time for bed" She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? Well, shake it up baby now
Twist and shout
Come on, come on, come, come on baby now
Come on and work it on out
Well, work it on out, honey

Ah, ah, ah, ah, look at all the lonely people Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong? Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong? Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah, ah, ah, ah look at all the lonely people Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
